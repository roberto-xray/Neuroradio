**Rhabdomyosarcomas of the head and neck** represent a large proportion (~40%) of all rhabdomyosarcomas and are the most common soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck. For a general discussion of this tumour, please refer to [rhabdomyosarcoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/rhabdomyosarcoma).

#### Pathology

There are usually of the [embryonal in cell subtype](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/embryonal-rhabdomyosarcoma) and are essentially only seen in children. They are classified by location into:

- [orbital rhabdomyosarcoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/rhabdomyosarcoma-orbit): good prognosis (90% long term survival)
- [para-meningeal rhabdomyosarcoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=parameningeal-rhabdomyosarcoma): worse prognosis (50% long term survival)
- other head and neck locations

Middle ear rhabdomyosarcomas are rare, accounting for only 7% of head and neck rhabdomyosarcomas. They typically present similarly to [chronic otomastoiditis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/chronic-otomastoiditis) and are usually diagnosed too late for curative treatment. Frequently (30%) cranial nerve involvement is present at the time of diagnosis.

##### Microscopic appearance

Histologically, rhabdomyosarcomas are low-grade [small round blue cell tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/small-round-blue-cell-tumours "Small round blue cell tumours"). Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma, and lymphoma share similar characteristics that make histopathologic differentiation of rhabdomyosarcoma hard.

#### Radiographic features

##### Ultrasound

Rhabdomyosarcomas resemble neuroblastomas in echotexture and often demonstrate low to medium echogenicity. With colour Doppler, there is often variable internal vascularity.

##### MRI

- **T1**: isointense to slightly hyperintense
- **T2**: hyperintense
- **T1 C+**: marked contrast enhancement
- +/- intralesional haemorrhage or necrosis
- +/- diffusion restriction 

#### Radiology report

As the differential diagnosis is vast, and the imaging findings are non-specific, it would be useful to describe in detail the:

- location
- involvement of adjacent compartments
- perineural, vascular, and osseous involvement
- presence of lymphadenopathy

#### Treatment and prognosis

Treatment depends on the location and disease extent, with orbital and non-parameningeal head and neck locations having a better prognosis. Chemotherapy is first line for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcomas, with radiation therapy and surgery utilised for local tumour control.

#### Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for more superficial non-parameningeal locations includes:

- [chondrosarcoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/chondrosarcoma)
- fibrosarcoma
- [synovial sarcoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/synovial-sarcoma)

The differential diagnosis for deeper parameningeal locations includes:

- haemangioendothelioma
- [nasopharyngeal carcinoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/nasopharyngeal-carcinoma)
- [osteosarcoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/osteosarcoma), and [primitive neuroectodermal tumour](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/primitive-neuroectodermal-tumour-of-the-cns-historical)

The sonographic differential also includes:

- fibrosarcoma
- [malignant fibrous histiocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/undifferentiated-pleomorphic-sarcoma-1)
- [angiosarcoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/angiosarcoma)
- [neurofibrosarcoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/malignant-peripheral-nerve-sheath-tumour)====
