**Infant-type hemispheric gliomas,** also known as **infant high-grade gliomas**, are high-grade brain tumours occurring in children.

#### Terminology

Infant-type hemispheric gliomas belong to the family of "paediatric high-grade diffuse gliomas" of the [2021 WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) 1. They have been recently recognised as a novel tumour type distinct from other paediatric high-grade gliomas, harbouring molecular mutations involving the receptor tyrosine kinases NTRK, [ROS1](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ros1-mutation), ALK, and MET_._

#### Epidemiology

Infant-type hemispheric gliomas typically arise in the first year of life (range: 0–12 months) 2.

#### Pathology

##### Subtypes

- infant-type hemispheric glioma, _NTRK_-altered
- infant-type hemispheric glioma, _ROS1_-altered
- infant-type hemispheric glioma, _ALK_-altered
- infant-type hemispheric glioma, _MET_-altered

##### Location

They are usually supratentorial 2,3.

##### Microscopic appearance

Infant-type hemispheric gliomas show astrocytic cells arranged in fascicles or sheets with mild to moderate pleomorphism. Moreover, like the other high-grade gliomas, they often display palisading necrosis, mitotic activity, and endothelial proliferation 2,3.

##### Immunophenotype and molecular alterations

- [GFAP](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/autoimmune-glial-fibrillary-acid-protein-gfap-astrocytopathy): positive
- [ALK](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=alk): sometimes positive in the infant-type hemispheric glioma _ALK_-altered
- diagnosis of these tumours generally requires detection of the fusion genes of tyrosine kinase _NTRK1_, _NTRK2_, _NTRK3_, _ROS1_, _ALK_, _MET_ or, alternatively, a characteristic methylation profile 1-3

#### Radiographic features

An infant-type hemispheric glioma usually appears as a huge supratentorial mass with [vasogenic oedema](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/vasogenic-cerebral-oedema), exerting a significant mass effect on the surrounding intracranial structures. Cases of leptomeningeal dissemination have been reported 4.

##### MRI

- show a heterogeneous signal on T1W and T2W sequences, often with necrosis and haemorrhage
- enhancement is present and is heterogeneous 2,3

#### Treatment and prognosis

More studies are needed to evaluate the survival rate and impact of targeted therapies. Infant-type hemispheric glioma _ALK_-altered subtype seems to have a better 5-year survival rate than the _ROS1-_ and _NTRK_-altered subtypes 2.
