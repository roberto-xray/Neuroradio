**Hybrid nerve sheath tumours** or **hybrid peripheral nerve sheath tumours (HPNST)** are benign [peripheral nerve sheath tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/peripheral-nerve-sheath-tumours) displaying combined morphological characteristics of more than one of the conventional tumour types such as schwannoma neurofibroma or perineurioma. Recognised combinations are:

- [schwannoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/schwannoma) + [perineurioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/perineurioma) (usually sporadic)
- [schwannoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/schwannoma) + [neurofibroma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibroma) (usually in the setting of [NF1](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibromatosis-type-1), [NF2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibromatosis-type-2-3) or schwannomatosis)
- [neurofibroma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibroma) + [perineurioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/perineurioma) (rare, usually in the setting of NF1)

#### Terminology

Another acceptable term of hybrid nerve sheath tumour is ‘**benign nerve sheath tumour NOS**’.

#### Epidemiology

Hybrid nerve sheath tumours are generally rare and tumours showing a hybrid morphology of schwannoma/perineurioma or neurofibroma/schwannoma are more common than the neurofibroma/perineurioma hybrid. They have been found in a wide age range but seem to have a peak in young adults. There is apparently no gender predilection 1-3.

##### Associations

The neurofibroma/schwannoma hybrid has been found in association with the following conditions 1,2:

- [schwannomatosis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/schwannomatosis)
- [neurofibromatosis type 2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibromatosis-type-2-3)
- [neurofibromatosis type 1](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibromatosis-type-1)

The neurofibroma/perineurioma hybrid has been associated with neurofibromatosis type 1, whereas the schwannoma/perineurioma hybrid seems to occur sporadically 1,2.

#### Diagnosis

The diagnosis of hybrid nerve sheath tumours is established by histological and immunohistochemical criteria 1.

##### Diagnostic criteria

Diagnostic criteria according to the [WHO classification of soft tissue and bone tumours (5th edition)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-tumors-of-soft-tissue) 1:

- mixed features of two different types of benign nerve sheath tumours
- appropriate immunohistochemistry of those components

#### Clinical presentation

Clinical features are similar to normal benign nerve sheath tumours. Lesions in the subcutaneous tissue and skin often manifest as painless mass, whereas lesions of spinal nerves and larger peripheral nerves can present with pain and neurological deficits 1.

#### Pathology

Hybrid nerve sheath tumours are characterised by mixed morphological and immunohistochemical features of at least two types of peripheral nerve sheath tumours 1-3.

##### Location

Hybrid nerve sheath tumours display a wide anatomic distribution but are most often found in the subcutaneous tissue and the dermis e.g. in the fingers whereas rare cases have been reported for the [cranial nerves](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cranial-nerves) 1-3.

##### Macroscopic appearance

Macroscopically hybrid nerve sheath tumours are well-demarcated lesions with a similar appearance to other benign nerve sheath tumours 1.

##### Microscopic appearance

The histological features of hybrid nerve sheath tumours differ with respect to the individual type and are characterised by the following 1,2:

- schwannoma/perineurioma
    - storiform or fascicular growth with multilobular architecture
    - a mixture of Schwann cells and perineural cells
- neurofibroma/schwannoma
    - possible plexiform architecture
    - solid nodular Schwann cell proliferation within loose neurofibroma background with myxoid changes
- neurofibroma/perineurioma
    - resemble plexiform neurofibroma with perineurial differentiation

##### Immunophenotype

Similar to histological features immunohistochemistry stains differ with respect to the individual type.

Schwann cells generally react to [S100](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/s100), perineurial areas usually demonstrate positivity for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), claudin 1 or Glut1 but not S100, whereas neurofibromatous components display a mixed picture of CD34, S100, SOX10, and EMA positivity 1-3.

#### Radiographic features

##### MRI

Descriptions of radiographic features of hybrid nerve sheath tumours are very scarce in the literature. One case report on a neurofibroma/schwannoma hybrid described and showed it with the fusiform appearance of a benign nerve sheath tumour and bright signal on STIR sequences as well as peripheral enhancement after gadolinium with relative large non-enhancing components 4.

#### Radiology report

The radiological report should include a description of the following:

- form, location and size
- tumour margins and transition zone
- affected nerve/plexus and relations to adjacent neurovascular structures
- relations to bones
- relations to the muscular fascia

#### Treatment and prognosis

Hybrid nerve sheath tumours are benign and rarely recur after local excision 1.

#### History and etymology

The first major work on hybrid nerve sheath tumours was published by the pathologists by the American pathologist Mel B. Feany and colleagues in 1998 2,5.

#### Differential diagnosis

Tumours or conditions which can mimic the presentation and/or appearance of a hybrid nerve sheath tumours are obviously their single morphologic counterparts 1:
