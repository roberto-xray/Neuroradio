**Myxopapillary ependymomas** are a variant type of [ependymoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/spinal-ependymoma) that occurs predominantly in the [filum terminale](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/filum-terminale) and/or [conus medullaris](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/conus-medullaris). They represent 13% of all spinal ependymomas and are the most common [tumours of the cauda equina region](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neoplasms-of-the-cauda-equina-differential).

#### Epidemiology

They tend to have an earlier clinical presentation than other spinal ependymomas, with a mean age of presentation of 35 years. There is a slight male predominance.

#### Clinical presentation

The most common presenting symptoms are low back, leg or sacral pain. Up to 25% of patients may present with leg weakness or sphincter dysfunction.

They may occasionally present as a [subarachnoid haemorrhage](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/subarachnoid-haemorrhage) 8.

#### Pathology

##### Aetiology

They are thought to arise from the ependymal glia of the [filum terminale](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/filum-terminale). 

##### Location

The vast majority are [intradural and extramedullary](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/intradural-extramedullary-spinal-tumours-1) spinal tumours, occurring in the lumbosacral spine involving the [filum](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/filum-terminale) [terminale](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/filum-terminale) and/or [conus medullaris](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/conus-medullaris). Less commonly, they extend from the lumbar to the thoracic spine 10. Rarely, they can arise in the cervicothoracic spine or fourth ventricle 11.

##### Grading

Historically, myxopapillary ependymomas were considered grade I tumours, however, in the 5thedition (2021) of the [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) they have been upgraded to grade 2 tumours in recognition of the fact that local recurrence is similar to that of other [spinal cord ependymomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/spinal-ependymoma) 12,13.

##### Macroscopic appearance

They are typically lobulated, encapsulated, and oval or sausage-shaped. They often have associated haemorrhage and may calcify or undergo cystic degeneration 9.

##### Microscopic appearance

Histologically, they contain papillary elements arranged radially around a hyalinized fibrovascular core, forming [perivascular pseudorosettes](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/perivascular-pseudorosettes-ependymoma), with myxoid material between the blood vessel and tumour cells 9. "Balloons" (rounded eosinophilic PAS positive structures) are sometimes encountered 9.  

##### Immunophenotype

As is the case with ependymomas generally, myxopapillary ependymomas are [GFAP](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glial-fibrillary-acid-protein-gfap), [S100](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/s100), and [vimentin](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/vimentin) positive 9. CD99, AE1/AE3 and NCAM1 are also commonly positive 9. 

#### Radiographic features

##### Plain radiograph / CT

If they become large, myxopapillary ependymomas may expand the spinal canal, cause scalloping of the vertebral bodies and extend out of the neural exit foramina.

##### MRI

They are well-defined intradural tumours. Classically, they present when larger and sausage-shaped, spanning more than one vertebral level, but small oval tumours are also seen. Smaller tumours tend to displace the nerve roots of the cauda equina; larger tumours often compress or encase them 8.

###### Signal characteristics

- **T1**
    - usually isointense
    - prominent mucinous component occasionally results in T1 hyperintensity
    - haemorrhage and calcification can also lead to regions of hyper- or hypointensity
- **T2**
    - overall high intensity
    - low intensity may be seen at the tumour margins because of haemorrhage, called the [cap sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/haemosiderin-cap-sign) (myxopapillary ependymomas are the subtype of ependymomas that are most prone to haemorrhage 8)
    - calcification may also lead to regions of low T2 signal
- **T1 C+ (Gd)**
    - enhancement is virtually always seen
    - the enhancement pattern is typically homogeneous. However, they can have a variable enhancement pattern that, in part, depends on the amount of haemorrhage present

#### Treatment and prognosis

Myxopapillary ependymomas are generally slow-growing but are considered WHO grade 2 tumours 13. Occasionally, CSF dissemination occurs and multiple lesions are seen in 14-43% cases 4. Some sacral lesions are locally aggressive and metastasise to lymph nodes, lungs, and bone. Aggressive behaviour is more commonly seen in children 9.  

They can often be excised completely. In these cases, the prognosis is excellent, with 5-year-survival over 98% 9.

If the tumour has extended to the conus medullaris, resection is often incomplete, with a greater risk of local recurrence, and there is a greater risk of neurologic deficit 11.

#### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis of a small conus and filum terminale myxopapillary ependymoma includes:

- [schwannoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/spinal-schwannoma)
- [paraganglioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/spinal-neuroendocrine-tumour)

Differential diagnosis of a large myxopapillary ependymoma that causes sacral destruction:

- [aneurysmal bone cyst](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/aneurysmal-bone-cyst): involving the spine
- [chordoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/chordoma)
- [giant cell tumour](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/giant-cell-tumour-of-bone): involving the spine
