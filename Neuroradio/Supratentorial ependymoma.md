**Supratentorial ependymomas** are an uncommon type of ependymoma, found within the cerebral hemispheres, either remote to or abutting the ventricles. 

They have distinct molecular features compared to both [posterior fossa ependymomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ependymoma) and [spinal ependymomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/spinal-ependymoma). 

#### Epidemiology

Overall, supratentorial ependymomas affect primarily children and adolescents, but also adults to a lesser degree 10. 

The epidemiology varies according to molecular subtype 7,9,10:

- supratentorial ependymoma, ZFTA fusion-positive
    
    - the majority of supratentorial ependymomas, especially in children
        
    - M:F = 2:1
        
    - age: older children
        
- supratentorial ependymoma, YAP1 fusion-positive
    
    - uncommon (<10% of all supratentorial ependymomas)
        
    - M:F = 1:3
        
    - age: <3 years of age
        

#### Clinical presentation

Supratentorial ependymomas usually present with headaches, seizures and focal neurological deficits compared to their infratentorial counterparts that mainly present with features of raised intracranial pressure.

#### Pathology

Although histologically similar, supratentorial ependymomas have a distinct molecular profile to the more common [posterior fossa ependymomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ependymoma). In the 5th edition (2021) of the [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1), supratentorial ependymomas are divided into 9,10: 

- supratentorial ependymoma, ZFTA (RELA) fusion-positive
    
- supratentorial ependymoma, YAP1-MAMLD1 fusion
    

In the minority of cases when these two common molecular alterations are absent (17-30%), or testing is inconclusive or unavailable, then the term supratentorial ependymoma [NEC](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/not-elsewhere-classified-nec) or [NOS](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/not-otherwise-specified-nos)should be used respectively 10. 

#### Radiographic features 

Radiologically these tumours have few characteristic features, appearing as heterogeneous parenchymal masses with calcification, cystic components, solid enhancing components and surrounding oedema. 

Although they can be located anywhere in the hemispheres, they seem to have a predilection for the frontal and parietal lobes 10. 

##### CT

- coarse calcification is common (50%) 
    
- cystic areas (50%) 
    
- solid component iso to hypodense
    
- heterogeneous enhancement 
    
- a small proportion can have haemorrhage
    
- non-contrast CT appearances of an intraparenchymal ependymoma is said to resemble a periwinkle flower, thus [periwinkle sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/periwinkle-sign-supratentorial-ependymoma-1) 8.
    

##### MRI

- **T1**
    
    - solid portions of ependymoma typically are isointense to hypointense relative to white matter 7
        
- **T2**
    
    - hyperintense to white matter
        
    - more reliable in differentiating tumour margins than non-contrast T1-weighted images (but less reliable than contrast-enhanced T1)
        
- **T2*** (e.g. **SWI**)
    
    - foci of blooming from haemorrhage or calcification
        
- **T1 C+ (Gd)**
    
    - enhancement present but heterogeneous
        
    - enhancement with gadolinium is useful in differentiating tumours from adjacent vasogenic oedema and normal brain parenchyma
        
- **DWI/ADC**
    
    - restricted diffusion may be seen in solid components especially in grade 3 tumours
        
    - diffusion should be interpreted with caution in masses with significant haemorrhage or calcification
        

##### Mnemonic

The imaging findings can be remembered by the “1234 rule”:

- 1: a single large tumour common in the first decade
    
- 2P: **P**erilesional oedema and **P**eriwinkle sign
    
- 3L: **L**arge **L**obulated **L**obar mass
    
- 4C: **C**entral **C**hunky **C**alcification and large peripheral **C**yst 
    

#### Treatment and prognosis

Treatment is primarily with maximal (hopefully complete) surgical resection 10. Recurrence is common and CSF spread is encountered fairly frequently, especially in grade 3 tumours 10.

Supratentorial ependymomas generally have a somewhat poorer prognosis than their more common posterior fossa counterparts 10. This is especially the case in children 7. 

ZFTA fusion-positive tumours have a poor prognosis, whereas YAP1 fusion-positive tumours appear to have a substantially better prognosis, despite their often large size at diagnosis 10. 

#### Differential diagnosis

Imaging differential considerations depend on whether the tumour is within the parenchyma (usually the case) or less commonly within the ventricle.
