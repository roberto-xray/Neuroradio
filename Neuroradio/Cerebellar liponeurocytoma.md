**Cerebellar** **liponeurocytomas**, also known as **neurolipocytomas**, are rare tumours of the cerebellum with neurocytic differentiation and abundant intracellular lipid. They are considered WHO grade 2 tumours 1. 

#### Epidemiology

These tumours have been reported at a wide range of ages (4-77 years) but seem to be encountered typically in adults of middle age 1,2. There is no strong gender predilection 1,2.

#### Clinical presentation

The clinical presentation is non-specific, relating to [raised intracranial pressure](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/raised-intracranial-pressure) (e.g. headache) and cerebellar signs (e.g. ataxia) 1.

#### Pathology

##### Location

As the name implies, the vast majority of cases of liponeurocytoma arise in the cerebellum 2. However, up to a fifth of reported cases have been supratentorial, around or within the ventricular system 2.

##### Classification

They are designated as WHO grade 2 tumours and considered one of the glioneuronal and neuronal tumours in the [WHO classification of central nervous system tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) 1,2,4.

##### Microscopic features

These tumours are composed of small neurocytic cells and neuroepithelial cells with abundant cytoplasmic lipid 1.

##### Immunophenotype

- [synaptophysin](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/synaptophysin): positive
- [neurone-specific enolase](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neuron-specific-enolase): positive
- [MAP2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=map2): positive
- [GFAP](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glial-fibrillary-acid-protein-gfap): positive

#### Radiographic features

Cerebellar liponeurocytomas appear as heterogeneous intra-axial or, uncommonly, intraventricular masses 2. The most common location is in the cerebellar hemispheres.

##### CT

The tumour is usually hypodense but occasionally isodense to surrounding parenchyma 2.

##### MRI

- **T1**: more commonly hypointense, sometimes isointense, only occasionally hyperintense to suggest macroscopic fat (18%) 2
- **T2/FLAIR**: usually hyperintense 2
- **T1 C+**: heterogeneous enhancement 1,2

##### PET

Cerebellar liponeurocytomas demonstrate high [C-11 methionine](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=c-11-methionine) uptake but lower [F-18 FDG](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/f-18-fluorodeoxyglucose) uptake than normal brain cortex 3.

#### Treatment and prognosis

Cerebellar liponeurocytomas can be cured with complete resection and adjuvant radiotherapy 2. However, recurrence is common with incomplete resection followed by radiotherapy (17%) or with complete resection without adjuvant radiotherapy (26%) 2.
