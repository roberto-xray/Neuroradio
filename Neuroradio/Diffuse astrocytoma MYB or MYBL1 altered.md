**Diffuse astrocytoma MYB or MYBL1 altered** is a newly recognised IDH wildtype paediatric-type diffuse low-grade glioma included in the 5th Edition (2021) [WHO brain tumour classification](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) 1. It has a generally favourable prognosis and is often associated with seizures 4. 

#### Epidemiology

Diffuse astrocytoma MYB or MYBL1 altered occurs in children and young adults (median age 5 years; range 0-26 years) 3.

#### Pathology

Diffuse astrocytoma MYB or MYBL1 altered is closely related, from a molecular point of view, to angiocentric gliomas that also share MYB altera_t_ions but lack their histological features 8. 

They are also closely related to [isomorphic diffuse gliomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=isomorphic+diffuse+glioma "isomorphic diffuse glioma"), not yet recognised as a distinct entity under the current (2021) [WHO brain tumour classification](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1), that also share MYBL1 alterations but tend to occur in adults and have a distinct [methylation profile](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dna-methylation "DNA-methylation") 8. 

##### Location

- hemispheres
    
- diencephalon
    
- brainstem 3
    

##### Microscopic appearance

Non-specific and low-grade histopathologic features with rare or absent mitotic activity 1,3.

##### Genetics

As these tumours are histologically non-specific it is essential to identify MYB/MYBL1 mutations for the diagnosis. 

- MYB or MYBL1 alternations 1,3,4
    
- H3 wildtype
    
- IDH wildtype
    

#### Radiographic features

The hemispheric cortical tumours appear as lobulated and infiltrative masses, while poorly defined and diffuse in the diencephalon and brainstem 3.

##### MRI

- **T1**: iso- or hypointense
    
- **T2/FLAIR:** heterogeneous hyperintensity
    
- **DWI/ADC:** no restricted diffusion
    
- **T1 C+ (Gd):** no enhancement 3
    

#### Treatment and prognosis

Although further studies are needed, the prognosis of these tumours is generally good 3.
