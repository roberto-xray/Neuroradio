# Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant

**Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant tumours** are WHO CNS grade 2, 3 or 4 tumours of the brain found in adults. They are diffuse infiltrating [astrocytic tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/astrocytic-tumours) where there is no identifiable border between the tumour and normal brain tissue, even though the borders may appear relatively well-marginated on imaging.

#### Terminology

The 5th edition (2021) update to the [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) has substantially changed the classification of astrocytic tumours, building upon the prior (2016) edition that started to define tumours based on molecular characteristics 19. 

What would previously in most instances have been known as a diffuse astrocytoma or [anaplastic astrocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/anaplastic-astrocytoma-historical) or secondary glioblastoma now all come under the one diagnosis, based on the presence of [IDH mutation](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/isocitrate-dehydrogenase) and the demonstrated absence of [1p19q codeletion](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/1p19q-codeletion), which if present would make the diagnosis of an [oligodendroglioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/oligodendroglioma) 16. 

These IDH-mutant astrocytomas are now graded 2, 3 or 4 based on histological and molecular features, but importantly a grade 4 tumour is no longer a glioblastoma, but rather just an astrocytoma, IDH-mutant WHO CNS grade 4 16. 

[Glioblastoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glioblastoma-idh-wildtype) is now considered a separate entity and distinct and must be IDH-wildtype, and is therefore discussed separately. 

Importantly, the diagnosis of astrocytoma, IDH-mutant is an adult-type diagnosis, distinct from a variety of other paediatric-type diffuse astrocytomas (see [astrocytic tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/astrocytic-tumours)).

The terms [fibrillary astrocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/fibrillary-astrocytoma-historical) and [protoplasmic astrocytomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/protoplasmic-astrocytoma-historical) are no longer recognised as separate entities 13. Although [gemistocytic astrocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/gemistocytic-astrocytoma-historical) are also no longer recognised as distinct entities, gemistocytic tissue pattern remains a histological feature 19. 

#### Epidemiology

IDH-mutant adult-type astrocytomas are typically diagnosed in young adults (median age of 36 years for grades 2 and 3 (combined), and 38 years for grade 4) 17. This is substantially younger than glioblastoma IDH-wildtype tumours (median 50-60 years of age) 17. 

There is a substantially higher incidence in men of all ages and of all grades tumour (M:F ~1.5) 1,17.

#### Clinical presentation

The most common presenting feature (~40% of cases) is a seizure. This is particularly the case in adults. Headaches are often also present. Depending on the size of the lesion and its location, other features may be present, such as [hydrocephalus](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hydrocephalus) and focal neurological dysfunction, including personality changes.

#### Pathology

Adult-type astrocytomas are predominantly composed of a microcystic tumour matrix within which are embedded fibrillary neoplastic astrocytes with mild nuclear atypia and a low cellular density. Often microcystic spaces containing mucinous fluid are present, a typical finding in what was previously known as [fibrillary astrocytomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/fibrillary-astrocytoma-historical), but even more characteristic and pronounced in what was previously known as [protoplasmic astrocytomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/protoplasmic-astrocytoma-historical). 

The occasional occurrence of gemistocytes in a diffuse astrocytoma does not justify the diagnosis of what was previously known as a [gemistocytic astrocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/gemistocytic-astrocytoma-historical), which tended to progress more rapidly to higher-grade tumours.

Mitoses, microvascular proliferation and necrosis are absent (if present they suggest a high-grade tumour). Like all tumours derived from astrocytes, diffuse astrocytomas stain with [glial fibrillary acid protein (gFAP)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glial-fibrillary-acid-protein-gfap) 2,3.

It is well recognised that pathological classification has a high interobserver variation and thus imperfectly predicts clinical outcomes 11. More recent studies have shown that the genetic status of these tumours is more reflective of their subtypes than the histologic grading (please refer to [isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/isocitrate-dehydrogenase "Isocitrate dehydrogenase") for a broad discussion on this topic) 11.  

##### Grading

The grading of astrocytoma, IDH-mutant is based on histological features, as well as incorporating molecular markers (introduced in the 5th edition (2021) [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1)) 19. 

1. grade 2
    
    - well-differentiated, low mitotic activity
        
    - no necrosis or microvascular proliferation
        
    - CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion absent
        
2. grade 3
    
    - anaplasia, significant mitotic activity
        
    - no necrosis or microvascular proliferation
        
    - CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion absent
        
3. grade 4
    
    - necrosis, and/or
        
    - microvascular proliferation, and/or
        
    - CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion
        

#### Radiographic features

MRI is the modality of choice for characterising these lesions, and in the case of smaller tumours, they may be subtle and difficult to see on CT, especially as they tend not to enhance.

##### CT

Typically low-grade infiltrating astrocytomas appear as isodense or hypodense regions of positive mass effect, often without any enhancement (in fact, the presence of enhancement would suggest higher grade tumours), although tumours with gemistocytic differentiation can demonstrate wispy enhancement.

Cystic or fluid attenuation components are also encountered, particularly in tumours with a gemistocytic component. 

##### MRI

Reported signal characteristics include:

- **T1**
    
    - isointense to hypointense compared to white matter
        
    - usually confined to the white matter and causes expansion of the adjacent cortex
        
- **T2/FLAIR** 
    
    - mass-like hyperintense signal that incompletely suppresses on FLAIR: [T2/FLAIR mismatch sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/t2flair-mismatch-sign-1)
        
    - always follow the white matter distribution and cause expansion of the surrounding cortex
        
    - cortex can also be involved in late cases in comparison to oligodendroglioma, which is a cortical-based tumour from the start
        
    - the "microcystic changes" along the lines of the spread of the infiltrative astrocytoma is a unique behaviour for the infiltrative astrocytoma; however, it is only appreciated in a small number of cases
        
    - high T2 signal is not related to cellularity or cellular atypia, but rather to oedema, demyelination, and other degenerative change 10
        
- **DWI/ADC**
    
    - typically has facilitated diffusion, with lower ADC values suggesting a higher grade
        
    - ADC values correlate with grade 15
        
        - grade 4 = 745 ± 135 x 10-6 mm2/s
            
        - grade 3 = 1067 ± 276 x 10-6 mm2/s
            
        - grade 2 = 1273 ± 293 x 10-6 mm2/s
            
- **T1 C+ (Gd)**
    
    - no enhancement in grade 2 tumours
        
    - solid areas of enhancement +/- necrosis suggest higher grade
        
- **MR spectroscopy**
    
    - typically will show elevated choline peak, low NAA peak, elevated [choline:creatine ratio](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/mr-spectroscopy-1)
        
    - elevated [_myo_-inositol](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/myo-inositol-peak-1) and _myo_-inositol/creatine ratio
        
    - there is a lack of the lactate peak seen at 1:33
        
    - the lactate peak represents the necrosis seen in grade 4 tumours
        
- **MR perfusion**
    
    - relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) will depend on the grade
        
        - grade 2: no elevation
            
        - grade 4: usually elevated especially in enhancing components
            

##### PET-CT

- has FDG uptake similar to the normal white matter
    
- FDG,18-F-choline and 11C-choline PET is useful for biopsy targeting the most hypermetabolic areas that are most likely the highest grade component
    

#### Treatment and prognosis

##### Treatment

Treatment depends on clinical presentation, tumour grade, as well as tumour size and location.

Historically low-grade tumours were managed as follows:

- biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and observe
    
- surgical resection if feasible
    
- usually radiotherapy at the time of recurrence or progression
    

In contrast, high-grade tumours have maximal safe resection followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy ([Stupp protocol](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/stupp-protocol-for-glioblastoma)).

There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests that concurrent chemoradiotherapy, usually reserved for tumours that progressed to higher grades, may be of benefit in lower grade tumours also. 

Similarly, there is evidence that resection of low-grade tumours is of benefit and that total resection of the T2 signal abnormality, or even "supramaximal resection" (resection of the normal-appearing brain beyond the margins of T2 signal abnormality) confers survival benefits 20. The extent of resection that is achievable will, however, depend on the location of the tumour and how circumscribed its margins are. 

Recently (2023) vorasidenib, an IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitor that is administered orally and can penetrate the [blood brain barrier](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/blood-brain-barrier-3 "Blood brain barrier"), has been shown to significantly prolong progression-free survival (27.7 months vs 11.1 months) 21.

##### Prognosis

Care must be taken when reviewing survival data as the classification system used (WHO 2007 vs 2016 vs 2021) will dramatically affect the results. 

The 5-year survival for adult-type astrocytoma IDH-mutant varies by grade 18: 

- grade 2 and 3 (combined): 9.3 years *
    
- grade 4: 3.6 years
    

* NB: It is almost certain that grade 2 tumours do somewhat better and grade 3 do somewhat worse, although little data on this exists on strictly molecular-based diagnosis (post-2016) 18.

#### Differential diagnosis

Possible imaging differential considerations include:

- [glioblastoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glioblastoma-idh-wildtype)
    
    - may be indistinguishable from grade 4 astrocytoma, IDH-mutant
        
    - tends to be in older patients
        
    - tends to have a less sizeable non-enhancing component
        
- [infarction](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/middle-cerebral-artery-mca-infarct): major vascular territory
    
- [cerebritis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cerebral-abscess-1)/encephalitis: [herpes simplex encephalitis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/herpes-simplex-encephalitis), [ADEM](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-adem-1)
