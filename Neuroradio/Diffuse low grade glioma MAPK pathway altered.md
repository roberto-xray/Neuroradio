**Diffuse low-grade glioma, MAPK pathway-altered** is a novel tumour type included in the 5thEdition (2021) of the [WHO brain tumour classification](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) 1.

#### Terminology

Several genetic mutations were recognised in low-grade IDH-wt/H3-wt brain diffuse gliomas occurring in children and adolescents, such as [_BRAF_ V600E mutation](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/braf-1), _FGFR_ alteration, and _MYB_/_MYBL1_ arrangement 2-7. Except for the last, all the above-mentioned mutations determine a direct up-regulation of the [RAS/MAPK pathway](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/mapk-pathway) and therefore these low-grade gliomas are likely expressions of a "one-pathway disease" 7. Moreover, it is important to emphasise that many other genetic alterations, such as NF1 tumour suppressor gene mutation, affect the [RAS/MAPK pathway](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/mapk-pathway)7. Therefore in 2019, the cIMPACT-now committee proposed to classify and distinguish low-grade paediatric diffuse gliomas on the basis of these genetic mutations 8.

The 5th edition (2021) of the [WHO brain tumour classification](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) introduced diffuse low-grade glioma MAPK pathway-altered in the family of "paediatric low-grade" diffuse gliomas 1.

#### Pathology

The term diffuse low-grade glioma MAPK pathway-altered encompasses a broad spectrum of histological features, including astrocytic, oligodendroglial, or mixed morphology 1, 7. Therefore, the correct identification of diffuse low-grade glioma MAPK pathway-altered requires molecular characterisation and in particular the detection of _BRAF_ or _FGFR_ mutations 1, 7.

#### Radiologic features

At the time of writing (c. 2022), there are few published radiological descriptions of brain tumours specifically falling into the category of diffuse low-grade gliomas MAPK pathway-altered. In general, it is possible to assume that their appearance is similar to the other diffuse low-grade gliomas belonging to the same family. It may appear as a heterogenous enhancing mass with cystic changes 9.

#### Treatment and prognosis

Specific data on the prognosis and treatment of diffuse low-grade glioma MAPK pathway-altered are not yet available. One may speculate that, as with other tumours in the same family, the prognosis is good, although the possibility of surgical resection depends on the location.
