**Central nervous system neuroblastoma, FOXR2-activated** is a novel brain tumour entity recently included in the [WHO brain tumour classification](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) 1.

#### Terminology

Central nervous system neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation was identified in 2016 as a new molecular entity, distinguished from [primitive neuroectodermal tumours of the central nervous system](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/primitive-neuroectodermal-tumour-of-the-cns-historical) based on its specific genetic and histopathological alterations 2.

It was included in the 5th edition (2021) of the [WHO brain tumour classification](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) among the “other CNS embryonic tumours” 1.

#### Epidemiology

Central nervous system neuroblastoma, FOXR2-activated is a rare tumour and occurs in young children (range 1-9.4 years old) 3.

#### Clinical presentation

Due to its rarity, not much clinical data are available although their presentation is presumably indistinguishable from other tumours in similar locations.

#### Pathology

##### Location

Central nervous system neuroblastoma, FOXR2-activated is a supratentorial tumour with seldom an interventricular localisation 3.

##### Microscopic appearance

It usually demonstrates poorly differentiated cells with embryonic appearance, high nucleus: cytoplasm ratio, round-shaped nuclei, and sometimes brisk mitotic proliferation. It may show necrosis, high vascularity, endothelial proliferation, nuclear pleomorphism, and perivascular pseudorosettes 1-3.

##### Immunochemistry

[Synaptophysin](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/synaptophysin) and [OLIG2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=olig2) are often positive, whereas [vimentin](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/vimentin) and [GFAP](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glial-fibrillary-acid-protein-gfap) are absent in most cases. The [Ki-67 index](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=Ki-67+index "Ki-67 index") is high ranging from 12%-50% 1-3.

##### Molecular markers

Alterations of the FOXR2 locus on chromosome Xp11.21 and a specific [methylation](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dna-methylation "DNA-methylation") profile are characteristic of this tumour.

#### Radiographic features

Central nervous system neuroblastoma, FOXR2-activated appears as mixed cystic and solid supratentorial mass with sharp margins and necrosis 3. In some cases, [leptomeningeal dissemination](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/leptomeningeal-metastases "Leptomeningeal metastases") has been described 1.

##### MRI

- **T1/T2 sequences**: heterogeneous signal with mild perilesional oedema
- **DWI**: solid component may show moderate or high restriction of diffusivity
- **T1 C+ (Gd)**: heterogeneous enhancement 3

#### Treatment and prognosis

Data about treatment and prognosis are still limited. 

#### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis includes the other CNS embryonic tumours such as:
