**Neurofibromas** are benign (WHO grade 1) [peripheral nerve sheath tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/peripheral-nerve-sheath-tumour-1) that are usually solitary and sporadic. There is, however, a strong association with [neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibromatosis-type-1), particularly for the plexiform subtype. 

Neurofibromas are generally divided into five morphological forms 1-8:

- localised/nodular intraneural neurofibroma
    
- localised/nodular cutaneous neurofibroma
    
- [diffuse cutaneous neurofibroma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/diffuse-cutaneous-neurofibroma) 
    
- [plexiform neurofibroma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/plexiform-neurofibroma) 
    
- [massive diffuse soft tissue neurofibroma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=massive-diffuse-soft-tissue-neurofibroma)
    

[Diffuse cutaneous neurofibromas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/diffuse-cutaneous-neurofibroma), [plexiform neurofibromas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/plexiform-neurofibroma) and [massive diffuse soft tissue neurofibromas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=massive-diffuse-soft-tissue-neurofibroma) have distinct radiological appearances and are therefore discussed separately. Localised cutaneous neurofibromas are generally not a radiological diagnosis, appearing as incidental findings on scans of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. 

As such, the remainder of this article is a general discussion focussing on **localised intraneural neurofibromas** which are by far the most common form of neurofibroma, representing 90% of these lesions 2.

#### Epidemiology

Peak presentation of sporadic localised intraneural neurofibromas is between 20 and 30 years of age 5 with no sex predilection. When in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 1 they appear earlier, generally in early childhood 6. 

##### Associations

The majority of localised intraneural neurofibromas are solitary and sporadic and not associated with [neurofibromatosis type 1](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibromatosis-type-1). However, when multiple neurofibromas are present (or [plexiform neurofibromas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/plexiform-neurofibroma)) then the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 is almost assured.

#### Clinical presentation

The clinical presentation of localised intraneural neurofibromas is non-specific and the result of either mass effect on surrounding lesions (or palpable lump) or neurogenic dysfunction. 

#### Pathology

They are considered WHO grade 1 tumours in the 5th edition (2021) [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) 6.

##### Macroscopic appearance

Unlike [schwannomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/schwannoma), neurofibromas are not encapsulated and infiltrate between the nerve fascicles, making resection difficult. They primarily affect superficial cutaneous nerves, but occasionally affect larger deep-seated nerves. 

##### Microscopic appearance

Localised intraneural neurofibromas are composed of Schwann cells and fibroblasts, containing a rich network of collagen fibres.

##### Immunophenotype

- S100 positive in the Schwann cells
    
- CD34 positive in the stroma 6
    

#### Radiographic features

General imaging features of neurofibromas:

##### CT

- well-defined hypodense mass
    
- minimal or no contrast enhancement
    

##### MRI

- **T1:** hypointense
    
- **T2**
    
    - hyperintense
        
    - [target sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/target-sign-peripheral-nerve-sheath-tumor)
        
        - a hyperintense rim and central area of a low signal may be seen
            
        - this is thought to be due to a dense central area of collagenous stroma
            
        - although this sign is highly suggestive of neurofibroma, it is occasionally also seen in [schwannomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/schwannoma) and [malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/malignant-peripheral-nerve-sheath-tumour)
            
    - [fascicular sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/fascicular-sign)
        
- **T1 C+ (Gd):** heterogeneous enhancement
    

#### Treatment and prognosis

For lesions not associated with neurofibromatosis type 1:

- localised and diffuse lesions may be treated surgically
    
- however, as neurofibromas infiltrate between nerve fascicles, they are unable to be separated from the parent nerve and complete excision requires the sacrifice of the nerve
    
- deep-seated lesions are therefore often managed conservatively
    
- local recurrence after excision is uncommon and malignant transformation is rare 2
    

For lesions associated with neurofibromatosis type 1:

- due to the multiplicity of lesions, unless debilitating symptoms are present, treatment of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 is often non-surgical
    
- plexiform neurofibromas are particularly difficult to resect, often leading to incomplete resection
    
- recurrence after resection is frequent
    
- plexiform neurofibromas demonstrate a significant potential for malignant transformation
    

##### Complications

Although neurofibromas are usually indolent tumours they sometimes have atypical features ([atypical neurofibroma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/atypical-neurofibroma)) and uncommonly undergo malignant transformation ([malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/malignant-peripheral-nerve-sheath-tumour). Malignant change of sporadic localised intraneural neurofibromas is most frequently seen in large neurofibromas, and even then it only occurs in 5-10% of tumours 6. 

Note, when atypical features are encountered in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 1, then the term [atypical neurofibromatous neoplasms of uncertain biologic potential (ANNUBP)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/atypical-neurofibromatous-neoplasms-of-uncertain-biologic-potential-annubp) should be used 6.
