**Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours** **(DNET)** are benign (WHO Grade 1) slow growing glioneuronal tumours arising from either cortical or deep grey matter. The vast majority are centred in cortical grey matter, arise from secondary germinal layers, and are frequently associated with [cortical dysplasia](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/focal-cortical-dysplasia) (in up to 80% of cases). They characteristically cause intractable focal seizures (see [temporal lobe epilepsy](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/temporal-lobe-epilepsy)). 

#### Epidemiology 

Typically these tumours are diagnosed in children or young adults, as a result of the investigation of seizures, which usually have childhood onset; in 90% of cases, the first seizure occurred before the age of 20 8. Only a slight male predilection is present 8. An association with [Noonan syndrome](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/noonan-syndrome)has been proposed 9,10.

#### Clinical presentation

The vast majority (90%) of DNETs present with longstanding treatment-resistant focal seizures without associated or progressive neurological deficits 5,13. 

#### Pathology

##### Location

DNETs are most often located in the temporal lobe although all parts of the CNS containing grey matter are potential locations. 

- [temporal lobe](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/temporal-lobe): over ~65% of cases 8
    
- [frontal lobe](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/frontal-lobe): ~20% of cases
    
- [caudate nucleus](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/caudate-nucleus)
    
- [cerebellum](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cerebellum): present more commonly with ataxia rather than seizures
    
- [pons](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pons)
    

##### Macroscopic appearance

Macroscopically, DNETs are visible on the surface of the brain, sometimes with an exophytic component. When sectioned they demonstrate heterogeneous, often gelatinous, cut surface with nodules of firmer tissue 8. 

##### Microscopic appearance

DNETs are a mixed glioneuronal neoplasm with a multinodular architecture and a heterogeneous cellular composition. The "specific glioneuronal element (SGNE)" is characteristic, and refers to columnar bundles of axons surrounded by oligodendrocyte-like cells which are orientated at right angles to the overlying cortical surface. Between these columns are "floating neurones" as well as stellate astrocytes 8.

Three histological forms are recognised 5: 

1. simple: SGNE only
    
2. complex: SGNE, with glial nodules and a multinodular architecture
    
3. non-specific: no SGNE, but otherwise the same clinical and neuroimaging features as complex DNET
    

[Focal cortical dysplasia](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/focal-cortical-dysplasia) is commonly seen in approximately half of patients who have concurrent epilespy 13. Unless a component can be identified clearly separate from tumour cells, then it does not warrant an additional separate diagnosis. If, however, such a separate component is present, then it represents [Blumcke classification IIIb](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/blumcke-classification-of-focal-cortical-dysplasia) focal cortical dysplasia 8. 

##### Immunophenotype

The stellate [astrocytes](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/astrocytes) within the SGNE are positive for [GFAP](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glial-fibrillary-acid-protein-gfap) 8. 

The oligodendrocyte-like cells are typically [S100](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/s100) and [OLIG2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=olig2) positive, and may also express [NOGO-A](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=nogo-a) and myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 8. 

The floating neurones are positive for [NeuN](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=neun) 8. 

Importantly, DNETs are negative for [IDH](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/isocitrate-dehydrogenase) mutations, [TP53](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/tp53-gene-1) mutations, and do not demonstrate [1p19q co-deletion](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/1p19q-codeletion) 8. These features are helpful in distinguishing DNETs from [low-grade astrocytomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/astrocytoma-idh-mutant-1) (usually IDH mutated) and [oligodendrogliomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/oligodendroglioma) (IDH mutated and 1p19q co-deleted). 

##### Genetics

DNETs usually harbour fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase domain duplication (FGFR1-TKDD), shared by pilocytic astrocytomas especially when located outside of the cerebellum 11,12. 

#### Radiographic features

DNETs are typically predominantly cortical and well-circumscribed tumours.

##### CT

DNETs appear as low-density masses, usually with no or minimal enhancement. When cortical, as is usually the case, they may scallop/remodel the inner table of the skull vault but without erosion. In some cases, the cranial fossa can be minimally enlarged at times. 

Calcification is visible in ~30% (more common histologically) and is typically visualised in the deepest parts of the tumour, particularly adjacent to enhancing or haemorrhagic areas 8. 

##### MRI

Typically seen as a cortical lesion with hardly any surrounding vasogenic oedema. 

- **T1**
    
    - generally hypointense compared with adjacent brain
        
- **T1 C+ (Gd)**
    
    - may show enhancement in ~20-30% of cases 5
        
    - enhancement may be heterogeneous or a mural nodule
        
- **T2**
    
    - generally high signal
        
    - high signal "[bubbly appearance](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/soap-bubble-appearance-dnet "Soap bubble appearance (DNET)")"
        
- **FLAIR**
    
    - mixed-signal intensity with [bright rim sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bright-rim-sign-dnet-1)
        
    - partial suppression of some of the "bubbles"
        
    - FLAIR is helpful in identifying the small peripheral lesions with similar intensity to CSF
        
- **T2*** 
    
    - calcification relatively frequent
        
    - haemosiderin staining is uncommon as bleeding into DNETs is only occasional
        
- **DWI**
    
    - no restricted diffusion
        
- **MR spectroscopy**
    
    - non-specific although lactate may be present
        

#### Treatment and prognosis

They demonstrate essentially no growth over time, although a very gradual increase in size has been described. Only one case of malignant transformation has been reported 5. 

Prognosis is excellent, however, due to the difficulty in managing seizures medically, patients usually undergo resection and even in cases of incomplete resection, seizures frequently cease. 

#### Differential diagnosis

The main differential diagnosis is that of other cortical tumours, with helpful distinguishing features including 1-6: 

- [ganglioglioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ganglioglioma)
    
    - contrast enhancement is more common
        
    - calcification in ~50% of cases
        
    - no "bubbly" appearance
        
- [pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pleomorphic-xanthoastrocytoma)
    
    - contrast enhancement prominent 
        
    - [dural tail sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dural-tail-sign-1) often seen 
        
- [diffuse low-grade astrocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/astrocytoma-idh-mutant-1)
    
    - IDH mutated
        
    - lacking histological specific glioneuronal element (SGNE)
        
- [oligodendroglioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/oligodendroglioma)
    
    - IDH mutated and 1p19q codeleted
        
    - lacking histological specific glioneuronal element (SGNE)
        
- [desmoplastic infantile astrocytomas and ganglioglioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/desmoplastic-infantile-gangliogliomaastrocytoma)
    
    - young children
        
    - dural involvement prominent 
        
    - large often multiple lesions
        

Importantly the "bubbly" appearance can be seen also in [multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumours (MVNT)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/multinodular-and-vacuolating-neuronal-tumour-1) which are however in the juxtacortical white matter, rather than in the cortex 7. 

The differential diagnosis also depends on the location of the tumour.
