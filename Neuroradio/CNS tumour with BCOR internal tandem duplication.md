**CNS tumour with _BCOR_ internal tandem duplication (BCOR-ITD)** is a rare and relatively new brain tumour type that has been added to the [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1 "WHO classification of CNS tumours") 5th edition as part of the embryonal family of tumours. Originally identified through molecular analysis of tumours classified as [primitive neuroectodermal tumours of the CNS](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/primitive-neuroectodermal-tumour-of-the-cns-historical "primitive neuroectodermal tumours of the CNS.") 1, they share similar clinical and imaging characteristics and are primarily an intra-axial tumour of young children occurring in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres 2. As yet only a small numbers of cases that include imaging findings have been reported in the literature 3.

#### Epidemiology

Tumours showing BCOR_-_ITD are more common in males (male to female ratio of 1.5) with an average age at diagnosis of 4.5 years 4. While the majority of cases occur in children, some cases in young adults have been reported 5.

Genetically related tumours with _BCOR_ fusion (rather than the tandem duplication) appear to occur with a more even gender distribution and with an older age at presentation 4.

#### Clinical presentation

Clinical symptoms are those of an intracranial mass lesion and include headaches alongside other symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, seizures and focal neurologic deficits 2,3.

#### Pathology

The causative recurrent internal tandem duplication occurs within exon 15 of the _BCOR_ transcriptional co‐repressor gene 1. Somatic alterations in _BCOR_ are associated with a variety of tumour types, with internal tandem duplications thought to be the driving mutation behind [clear cell sarcomas of the kidney](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/clear-cell-sarcoma-of-the-kidney "clear cell sarcomas of the kidney") and the [sarcoma with BCOR genetic alteration](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/sarcoma-with-bcor-genetic-alteration "Sarcoma with BCOR genetic alteration") 2.

##### Microscopic appearance

CNS tumours showing BCOR_-_ITD are typically densely cellular and well-circumscribed from the normal brain parenchyma 2,3,5, though occasionally showing infiltration at their interface with the surrounding brain 2. Tumour cells have round to oval nuclei. Ependymoma-like perivascular pseudorosettes, palisading necrosis and a dense capillary network without microvascular proliferation have been described as features 2,5.

##### Immunophenotype

- BCOR: strong and diffuse positive expression 5
    
- OLIG2: positive in most tumours with variable labelling of cells 2,5
    
- GFAP: majority of tumour cells negative 2,5
    
- NeuN: positive in most tumours with variable labelling of cells 2
    
- synaptophysin (Syn): negative 2,5
    
- epithelial membrane antigen (EMA): negative 2,5
    

#### Radiographic features

Currently, only a few short case series have been published describing imaging findings in CNS tumours with BCOR-ITD. As such it is likely the imaging findings associated with this tumour type will evolve with further publications.

A case series of 10 patients published by Cardoen et al 3 described peripheral well-defined intra-axial masses occurring in both the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. The tumours were large at presentation and commonly abutted the dura without invasion. Areas of central necrosis were common, with some of the masses showing calcifications or areas of haemorrhagic change. The masses demonstrated minimal to no surrounding vasogenic oedema and only mild heterogenous enhancement. In 9 of 10 cases, large vessels draining to overlying cortical veins were seen within the tumour. Similar imaging findings were described in a case series of 10 additional patients published by Ferris et al 2.

Approximately 8% show CNS dissemination at the time of diagnosis 4.

##### MRI

- **T1**: hypointense to grey matter
    
- **T2/FLAIR:** slightly hyperintense to grey matter
    
- **T1 C+ (Gd):** mild heterogenous enhancement
    
- **DWI/ADC**: reduced diffusivity, with similar ADC values to that of cortex.
    
- **perfusion**: relatively low [cerebral blood flow (CBF)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cerebral-blood-flow-cbf "Cerebral blood flow (CBF)") values compared to normal parenchyma
    

#### Treatment and prognosis

Treatment consists of gross total resection where possible and a regimen of chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy 2.

#### Differential diagnosis

- [embryonal tumour with multilayered rosettes](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/embryonal-tumour-with-multilayered-rosettes "Embryonal tumour with multilayered rosettes")
    
    - similar imaging features, including intra-tumoural veins, restricted diffusion, minimal or absent oedema and frequent calcifications
        
    - do not demonstrate frequent central necrosis
        
- [atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumour (AT/RT)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/atypical-teratoidrhabdoid-tumour "Atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumour (AT/RT)")
    
    - more commonly show peripheral cystic components, mild surrounding oedema and more marked enhancement of solid components
        
    - CNS dissemination is common at the time of diagnosis
        
- [medulloblastoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/medulloblastoma "Medulloblastoma")
    
    - SSH subtype are typically peripherally located but show a more diffuse nodular pattern of growth
        
    - group 3 and 4 subtypes typically arise from the vermis
