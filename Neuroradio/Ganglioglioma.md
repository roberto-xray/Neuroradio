**Gangliogliomas** are uncommon, usually low-grade, CNS tumours. They are considered [long-term epilepsy-associated tumours (LEATs)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/long-term-epilepsy-associated-tumours "LEATs") with medically refractory [epilepsy](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/epilepsy "Epilepsy") being a common clinical presentation. This tumour has a predilection for the temporal lobes, although they have been described in all parts of the central nervous system.

Their appearance on imaging is very variable: from a partially cystic mass with an enhancing mural nodule (~45% of cases) to a solid mass expanding the overlying gyrus. Contrast enhancement is variable.

#### Epidemiology

Children and young adults are usually affected, and no gender predominance is recognised. It accounts for around 2% (from 0.4-3.8%) of all primary intracranial tumours, and up to 10% of primary cerebral tumours in children.

#### Clinical presentation

The most common presentation is with [temporal lobe epilepsy](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/temporal-lobe-epilepsy), presumably due to the temporal lobes being a favoured location.

#### Pathology

Gangliogliomas are most frequently found in the temporal lobes (70%) 6,9 but occur anywhere in the central nervous system.

The majority are indolent and designated as WHO grade 1 tumours in the current (2021) [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1), although in a minority (e.g. 5%) of cases higher grade features are present 10. These have previously been called "anaplastic gangliogliomas" although no clear grading criteria for higher-grade tumours exist at present 10. 

##### Microscopic appearance

Gangliogliomas, as their name suggests, are composed of two cell populations:

1. ganglion cells (large mature neuronal elements): ganglio-
    
2. neoplastic glial element: -glioma
    
    - primarily astrocytic, although oligodendroglial or pilocytic astrocytoma components are also encountered 9
        

The proportion of each component varies widely, and it is the grade of the glial component that determines biological behaviour.

Dedifferentiation into high-grade tumours does occasionally occur, and it is usually the glial component (into a [glioblastoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glioblastoma-idh-wildtype)). Only rarely is it the neuronal component (into [neuroblastoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neuroblastoma)).

They are closely related to both [gangliocytomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/gangliocytoma) (which contain only the mature neural ganglion cellular component) and [ganglioneurocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ganglioneurocytoma) (which also have small mature neoplastic neurones). 

##### Immunophenotype

Neuronal origin is demonstrated by positivity to neuronal markers 9:

- [synaptophysin](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/synaptophysin): positive
    
- [neurofilament protein](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=neurofilament): positive
    
- [MAP2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=map2): positive
    
- [chromogranin-A](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/chromogranin-a): positive (usually negative in normal neurones) 9
    
- [CD34](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cd34): positive in 70-80%
    

The glial component may also show cytoplasmic positivity for [GFAP](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glial-fibrillary-acid-protein-gfap). 

##### Genetics

- [BRAF V600E mutations](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/braf-1) are encountered in 20-60% of cases 9
    
- [IDH](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/isocitrate-dehydrogenase-idh-1): negative (if positive then the tumour is most likely a diffuse glioma) 9
    

#### Radiographic features

Imaging findings mirror the various patterns of growth which these tumours may demonstrate and thus their appearance is very variable. A partially cystic mass with an enhancing mural nodule is seen in ~45% of cases. They may also simply present as a solid mass expanding the overlying gyrus. An infiltrating mass is uncommon and may reflect a higher grade.

##### CT

Findings are of a mass that is often non-specific. General features include:

- iso- or hypodense
    
- frequently calcified ~35%
    
- bony remodelling or thinning can indicate the slow-growing nature of a tumour
    
- enhancement is seen in approximately 50% of cases (involving the solid non-calcified component)
    

##### MRI

Reported signal characteristics include:

- **T1:** solid component iso to hypointense
    
- **T1 C+ (Gd):** solid component variable contrast enhancement
    
- **T2**
    
    - hyperintense solid component
        
    - variable signal in the cystic component depending on the amount of proteinaceous material or the presence of blood products
        
    - peritumoral FLAIR/T2 oedema is distinctly uncommon
        
- **T2* (GE/SWI):** calcified areas (common) will show blooming signal loss
    

#### Treatment and prognosis

Local resection is the treatment of choice and determines prognosis. In the brain, when a reasonable resection margin can be achieved, the prognosis is excellent, with recurrence-free survival reported to be up to 97% at 7.5-year follow-up 9.

In contrast, when resection is not possible due to location (e.g. the spinal cord) tumour progression is common 9.

If only incomplete resection is achievable, or tumour recurrence occurs then radiotherapy may be of some benefit.

#### Differential diagnosis

The main differential diagnosis is that of other cortical tumours, with helpful distinguishing features including 1-6:

- [dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours (DNET)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dysembryoplastic-neuroepithelial-tumour)
    
    - contrast enhancement uncommon
        
    - "bubbly appearance" common
        
- [pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pleomorphic-xanthoastrocytoma)
    
    - contrast enhancement prominent
        
    - [dural tail sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dural-tail-sign-1) is often seen
        
- [oligodendroglioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/oligodendroglioma)
    
    - calcifications common
        
- [desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma and ganglioglioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/desmoplastic-infantile-gangliogliomaastrocytoma)
    
    - young children
        
    - dural involvement prominent
        
    - large often multiple lesions
        

If in the spinal cord consider:

- [astrocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/astrocytic-tumours)
    
- [ependymoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ependymoma)
