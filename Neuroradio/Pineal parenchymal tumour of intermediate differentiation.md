**Pineal parenchymal tumours of intermediate differentiation (PPTID)** are, as the name suggests, tumours that fall between [pineocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pineocytoma) (well-differentiated, WHO grade 1) and [pineoblastomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pineoblastoma) (poorly differentiated, WHO grade 4). They are considered WHO grade 2 or 3 tumours 4. Their radiographic appearance and biological behaviour are also intermediate. 

#### Epidemiology

Although these tumours are encountered at all ages, they are particularly seen in middle-aged adults (20-70 years of age) with slight female predilection, similar to that of pineocytomas 4. 

#### Pathology

##### Macroscopic appearance

Pineal parenchymal tumours with intermediate differentiation have a similar macroscopic appearance to pineocytomas, appearing relatively well-circumscribed with heterogeneous cut surface 4.

##### Microscopic appearance

Two microscopic patterns are encountered, sometimes co-existing 4:

1. lobulated
2. diffuse

In the lobulated pattern, poorly defined lobules are separated from each other by large fibrous vessels 4.

The diffuse pattern, on the other hand, is reminiscent of [oligodendrogliomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/oligodendroglioma) and/or [central neurocytomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/central-neurocytoma), with the large pineocytomatous rosettes characteristic of [pineocytomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pineocytoma) not being evident 4.

##### Immunophenotype

- [synaptophysin](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/synaptophysin): positive 4
- NFP: variable
- [NeuN](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=neun): negative

#### Radiographic features

The features of pineal parenchymal tumours with intermediate differentiation range from those of [pineocytomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pineocytoma) to those of [pineoblastomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pineoblastoma), and they are therefore not repeated here.

When faced with a well-circumscribed pineal tumour with appearances of a pineocytoma, fairly rapid growth and/or low ADC values are clues that it may, in fact, represents a pineal parenchymal tumour with intermediate differentiation. 

As these tumours may invade adjacent structures and also spread along CSF and therefore imaging of the entire craniospinal axis is therefore required 3.

#### Treatment and prognosis

Like everything else about this tumour, treatment and prognosis are intermediate falling between that of [pineocytomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pineocytoma) and of [pineoblastomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pineoblastoma).
