**Angiocentric gliomas** are rare, superficial slow-growing WHO grade 1 brain tumours typically presenting in paediatric patients with intractable focal epilepsy 1-6. 

#### Epidemiology

Angiocentric gliomas are very rare tumours with relatively few reported cases. They usually affect children and young adults 1,6. No reported gender predilection has been reported 1. 

##### Associations

[Cortical dysplasia](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/focal-cortical-dysplasia) may be associated.

#### Clinical presentation

Seizures are the classical presentation, with over 95% of patients presenting with intractable seizures 3.

#### Pathology

Angiocentric gliomas are considered paediatric-type diffuse low-grade gliomas and designated as WHO grade 1 tumour in the current [WHO brain tumour classification](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) 1-3,7. The exact aetiology of angiocentric gliomas remains unclear although some features are similar to [ependymomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ependymoma) 1,6. In fact, sometimes, a distinct ependymoma component may co-exist 1.

##### Microscopic appearance

These tumours demonstrate a monomorphic population of elongated spindle-shaped bipolar cells with a strikingly perivascular orientation, somewhat reminiscent of [perivascular pseudorosettes](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/perivascular-pseudorosettes-ependymoma) 1,6. Although tumour cells do extend into the surrounding parenchyma, a strong predilection for perivascular spread is evident 6. Subpial growth along the surface of the cortex is also a prominent feature 1,6.

##### Immunophenotype

The immunophenotype shares some similarities to [ependymomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ependymoma) 1. 

- [GFAP](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glial-fibrillary-acid-protein-gfap): positive
    
- [EMA](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/epithelial-membrane-antigen-ema): both surface and perinuclear cytoplasmic dot may be present
    

Ki-67 index is usually <5% 1. 

They do not demonstrate neuronal markers (e.g. [synaptophysin](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/synaptophysin), [chromogranin-A](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/chromogranin-a), neuronal nuclear antigen) and they are [isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/isocitrate-dehydrogenase) negative.

##### Genetics

- MYB-QKI gene fusion 8
    
- IDH-wildtype
    

#### Radiographic features

Angiocentric gliomas are usually cortical or subcortical (grey-white matter junction), typically well-delineated, supratentorial tumours that tend to expand affected gyri. They exhibit a propensity to spread horizontally in the subpial plane and deeply along vessels 1.

##### CT

Typically appear as an expansile non-enhancing cortical tumour.

##### MRI 

- **T1**
    
    - hypointense
        
    - hyperintense rim may be seen
        
- **T2/FLAIR**
    
    - hyperintense
        
    - extension toward the ventricles along vessels
        
    - may have cystic-appearing areas
        
- **T1 C+ (Gd):** no enhancement
    

#### History and etymology

Angiocentric glioma was initially identified in 2005 in two separate case reports 2,5 and then introduced in the [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) in 2007.

#### Differential diagnosis

Given their rarity, on purely imaging grounds it is difficult to distinguish these tumours from more common diffuse gliomas (both [astrocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/astrocytic-tumours) and [oligodendroglioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/oligodendroglioma)). Other imaging differential considerations include:

- [focal cortical dysplasia](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/focal-cortical-dysplasia)
    
- [cortical tuber](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cortical-tubers) (_forme fruste_ of [tuberous sclerosis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/tuberous-sclerosis))
    
- [DNET](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dysembryoplastic-neuroepithelial-tumour) 
    
    - "bubbly" cortical and subcortical lesion
        
    - rim of high signal on FLAIR
        
    - minimal surrounding oedema
        
- [perivascular spaces](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/perivascular-spaces)
    
    - total nulling on the FLAIR sequence
