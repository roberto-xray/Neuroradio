**Extraventricular neurocytomas**, previously known as **cerebral neurocytomas**, are rare WHO grade 2 primary CNS neoplasms usually arising in the cerebral hemispheres. They are, as the name implies, extraventricular versions of [central neurocytomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/central-neurocytoma). 

#### Epidemiology

These tumours are reported at essentially all ages without a sex predilection 5. 

#### Clinical presentation

No specific clinical features are present, with presentation depending on the size and location of the tumour. Seizures, headaches and focal neurological defects are typical manifestations. 

#### Pathology

Extraventricular neurocytomas can occur anywhere in the CNS, including the spinal cord 5. 

##### Microscopic appearance

The tumours are of neuronal origin and are similar to the comparatively more common [central](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/central-neurocytoma) [neurocytomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/central-neurocytoma) which are intraventricular. They too demonstrate a variety of histological patterns but are generally less densely cellular 5. 

##### Immunophenotype

- [synaptophysin](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/synaptophysin): positive and essential to the diagnosis 5
    
- [GFAP](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glial-fibrillary-acid-protein-gfap): may be positive if an astrocytic component is present
    
- IDH R132H: negative
    

##### Genetics

IDH mutations are absent and are critical in distinguishing an extraventricular neurocytoma from the more common [oligodendroglioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/oligodendroglioma), as both can demonstrate [1p19q co-deletion](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/1p19q-codeletion) 5. 

Additionally FGFR (FGFR1-TACC1 fusion) is commonly identified and is an important diagnostic feature 6. 

##### Variants

When a distinct ganglion cell population is present the term [ganglioneurocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ganglioneurocytoma) can be used 5. 

#### Radiographic features

Lesions tend to be generally circumscribed, complex and sometimes large, complex, and variably enhancing masses. They are often partly or mainly cystic and calcification is not uncommon(>10%). They may or may not be associated with peritumoral oedema. 

##### MRI 

In most instances, they are well-defined, often mixed cystic heterogeneously solid lesions that involve the deep white matter or the cortical grey matter of the cerebral hemispheres. 

- **T1 C+**: solid portions may show varying degrees of enhancement
    

#### Treatment and prognosis

As these are relatively indolent and well-demarcated tumours, complete surgical resection can effect a cure 5. CSF dissemination is reported but is rare 5.
