**Polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumour of the young (PLNTY)** is an epileptogenic tumour of children and young adults.

#### Terminology

First described in 2016 1, polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumour of the young has been recently included in the new family of "paediatric-type" low-grade diffuse gliomas in the [5th Edition (2021) WHO brain tumour classification](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) 2 (WHO grade 1 tumour).

#### Epidemiology

Polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumour of the young mainly occurs in children and young adults 3.

#### Clinical presentation

Most of the patients present with seizures resistant to anti-epileptogenic drugs 3.

#### Pathology

##### Location

Polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumour of the young commonly arises from the cortex and in the temporal lobes, although other locations have been reported (such as frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes) 3,4.

##### Microscopic appearance, immunochemistry and genetics

Polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumour of the young is typically characterised by oligodendroglioma-like cellular elements, calcifications, and a strong CD34 immunopositivity. Moreover, it frequently shows the mutation of [_BRAF_](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/braf-1) V600E gene and fibroblast growth factor receptors 2 and 3, all of them involved in the regulation of the [MAPK oncogenic pathway](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/mapk-pathway) 3-5.

#### Radiographic features

Polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumours of the young display a solid or partially cystic appearance with unclear margins. It usually does not produce a significant mass effect 3-5.

##### CT

Polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumour of the young may appear as a hypo- or hyperdense mass, frequently calcified 3-5.

##### MRI

Reported signal characteristics include

- **T1:** iso- or hypointense
    
- **T2/FLAIR**: heterogeneous hyperintensity with the "[salt and pepper](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/salt-and-pepper-sign-disambiguation)" sign (likely due to calcifications)
    
- **T2*/SWI**: "[blooming](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/blooming-artifact-mri)" for calcifications
    
- **DWI/ADC**: no restricted diffusion
    
- **T1 C+ (Gd)**: slight or no enhancement 3-5.
    

#### Treatment and prognosis

Surgery is curative and therefore the prognosis is good 3-5. 

#### Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis generally includes other epileptogenic entities 3.

- [dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dysembryoplastic-neuroepithelial-tumour) [tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dysembryoplastic-neuroepithelial-tumour): clear margins and a "[soap-bubble](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/soap-bubble-appearance-differential-diagnosis-1)" appearance
    
- [pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pleomorphic-xanthoastrocytoma): [dural tail sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dural-tail-sign-1 "Dural tail sign") and significant contrast enhancement
    
- [ganglioglioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ganglioglioma): cystic mass with an intense enhancing mural nodule; often no calcifications are seen
    
- [oligodendroglioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/oligodendroglioma): often occurs in adults and arises in the frontal lobes; calcifications are in most cases "ribbon-like" or peripherally distributed
    
- [focal cortical dysplasia](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/focal-cortical-dysplasia): characterised by the thickening of the cortex, blurring of white matter-grey matter junction and the [transmantle sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/transmantle-sign-brain)
