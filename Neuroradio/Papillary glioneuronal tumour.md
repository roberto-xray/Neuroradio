**Papillary glioneuronal tumours** are rare well circumscribed complex solid cystic supratentorial lesion with an indolent clinical course.

#### Epidemiology

These tumours typically are diagnosed in younger patients (median age at diagnosis 23 years) but are reported essentially in all ages 4. No sex predilection has been identified 4. 

#### Clinical presentation

Clinical presentation is non-specific, primarily comprising seizures and/or headaches. Focal neurological deficits may also be present. 

#### Pathology

Papillary glioneuronal tumours were first recognised in the 2007 edition of the [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) and are considered WHO grade 1 tumours 6.

The majority of these tumours are in the cerebral hemispheres, with occasional intraventricular tumours described 4. 

##### Macroscopic appearance

These tumours usually demonstrate a mixture of solid and cystic components, sometimes with calcification 4. 

##### Microscopic appearance

Papillary glioneuronal tumours contain both glial (astrocytic) and neural elements. Characteristic microscopic features are hyalinized vascular pseudopapillary architecture with a pseudostratified layer of cuboidal glial cells and focal collections of neurocytes and ganglion cells.

##### Immunophenotype

Immunohistochemistry of the cuboidal glial cells reflects their glial appearance 4: 

- [GFAP](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glial-fibrillary-acid-protein-gfap): positive
- [S100](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/s100): positive
- [nestin](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/nestin): positive

In contrast, the neuronal components show a separate immunophenotype 4:

- [synaptophysin](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/synaptophysin): positive
- [neurone-specific enolase](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neuron-specific-enolase): positive
- class III beta-tubulin: positive

These tumours demonstrate a low Ki-67 proliferation index/MIB-1 index ~1-2% 1-4. Rarely, tumours with higher mitotic index are encountered and some have more aggressive behaviour 4. 

##### Genetics

Papillary glioneuronal tumours have a unique fusion oncogene _SLC44A1-PRKCA_ resulting from a translocation t(9; 17)(q31; q24) 5. 

#### Radiographic features

Features on imaging are very similar to [ganglioglioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ganglioglioma). They are supratentorial solid-cystic or cystic with solid nodule lesions showing intense but heterogeneous enhancement. Calcification is a frequent finding 1-4. Haemorrhage is seen in ~10% of cases and is sometimes very pronounced 4. 

##### MRI

- **T1**: isointense to hypointense 
- **T2**: inhomogeneously hyperintense
- **FLAIR**:
    - inhomogeneously hyperintense nodule
    - cystic components may suppress
- **T1 C+**: avid but heterogeneous enhancement of the solid nodule 

#### Treatment and prognosis

Papillary glioneuronal tumours are indolent and surgical resection is usually sufficient to effect a cure. In cases where proliferation is high (e.g. Ki-67 >5%) then local recurrence has been described 4.  

#### Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis is primarily of other parenchymal tumours with mixed solid and cystic components, including:

- [gangliogliomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ganglioglioma) and [gangliocytomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/gangliocytoma)
- [pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pleomorphic-xanthoastrocytoma)
- [pilocytic astrocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pilocytic-astrocytoma)
- diffuse astrocytoma, particularly [gemistocytic astrocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/gemistocytic-astrocytoma) and [oligodendrogliomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/oligodendroglioma) (if calcification prominent)
- [rosette-forming glioneuronal tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/rosette-forming-glioneuronal-tumours) (particularly if midline/posterior fossa)
