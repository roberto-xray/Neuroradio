**Diffuse brainstem gliomas** or **diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas** was a term used to describe infiltrating [astrocytomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/astrocytic-tumours) arising in the brainstem, usually in children. It is no longer recognised as a distinct entity, removed from the 2016 update to the [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) replaced by a variety of entities defined on the basis of molecular characteristics. The majority of these tumours would now be classified as [diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M–mutant](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/diffuse-midline-glioma-h3-k27-altered) which, for the sake of clarity, are described separately. 

#### Terminology

Recently, it has become apparent that a large proportion of these tumours (particularly diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas) harbour K27M mutations in the histone H3 gene H3F3A, or, less commonly, in the related HIST1H3B genes. These mutations are shared by other midline paediatric tumours (e.g. thalamic and spinal cord tumours).

As of the 2016 update to the WHO classification of CNS tumours, these have been given a distinct and separate diagnosis: [diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M–mutant](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/diffuse-midline-glioma-h3-k27-altered).

The rest (i.e. diffuse tumours of the brainstem gliomas without K27M mutations) now are classified as a variety of lesions including [diffuse paediatric-type high-grade gliomas, H3-wildtype and IDH-wildtype](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/diffuse-paediatric-type-high-grade-gliomas-h3-wildtype-and-idh-wildtype).

**NOTE:** The remainder of this article is therefore largely of historical relevance only. 

#### Epidemiology 

These tumours typically present in childhood (3 to 10 years of age) and account for 10-15% of all paediatric brain tumours, 20-30% of [paediatric posterior fossa tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/paediatric-posterior-fossa-tumours) and 60-75% of all brainstem gliomas. 

There is an association with [neurofibromatosis type I](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibromatosis-type-1), which however carries a better prognosis with a more indolent course.

#### Clinical presentation 

Typically patients present with multiple cranial nerve palsies, depending on the location of the tumour, and signs of raised intracranial pressure. Cerebellar signs may also be elicited including ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus and sleep apnoea.

#### Pathology

Recent genomic work has uncovered distinct mutations found in the majority of diffuse midline gliomas, particularly diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG). These mutations are in the histone H3F3A gene (K27M mutations) or less frequently HIST1H3B and HIST2H3C genes 5,6. 

As of the 2016 update to the [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1), diffuse intrinsic brainstem glioma (DIBG) has been removed and [diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M–mutant](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/diffuse-midline-glioma-h3-k27-altered) has been added as a specific entity 6. 

#### Radiographic features

Diffuse brainstem gliomas can be found throughout the brainstem:

- mesencephalic
- pontine: most common accounting for 60-75% of all cases
- medullary: least common location

In diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) the pons is enlarged, with the basilar artery displaced anteriorly against the [clivus](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/clivus) and potentially engulfed. The floor of the fourth ventricle is flattened ("[flat floor of fourth ventricle sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/flat-floor-of-fourth-ventricle-sign)") and [obstructive hydrocephalus](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/obstructive-hydrocephalus) may be present. Occasionally the tumour is exophytic, either outwards into the [basal cisterns](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/basal-cisterns) or centrally in the [4th ventricle](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/fourth-ventricle).

Usually, the tumour is homogeneous pre-treatment, however, in a minority of patients areas of necrosis may be present.

##### CT

Typically hypodense with little, if any, enhancement.

##### MRI

- **T1:** decreased intensity
- **T2:** heterogeneously increased
- **T1 C+ (Gd):** usually minimal (can enhance post-radiotherapy)
- **DWI:** usually normal, occasionally mildly restricted

#### Treatment and prognosis

Due to the high rate of severe complications with biopsy treatment has historically been commenced without histological confirmation, although due to the recent identification of distinct mutations (see [diffuse midline glioma H3 K27M–mutant](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/diffuse-midline-glioma-h3-k27-altered)) stereotactic biopsy is being performed in some centres, and may become routine when therapies specifically targeted to these mutations become available 5.

Radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. The initial response may be falsely reassuring.

In the sporadic form, the prognosis is poor with 2-year survival being only 20% (median survival less than 1 year). This is dramatically different from [focal brainstem gliomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/focal-brainstem-glioma) (e.g [pilocytic astrocytomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/pilocytic-astrocytomas) and [tectal gliomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/tectal-glioma)), which carry a good prognosis.

#### Differential diagnosis

General imaging differential considerations include:

- [rhombencephalitis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/rhombencephalitis)
- [acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-adem-1)
- [neurofibromatosis type I (NF1)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibromatosis-type-1)
- [tuberous sclerosis (TS)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/tuberous-sclerosis)
- [osmotic demyelination](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/osmotic-demyelination-syndrome)
- [Langerhans cell histiocytosis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/langerhans-cell-histiocytosis)
- [hamartoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hypothalamic-hamartoma)

They should also be distinguished from other tumours:

- [medulloblastoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/medulloblastoma)
- [ependymoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ependymoma)
