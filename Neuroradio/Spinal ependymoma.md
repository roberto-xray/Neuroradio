**Spinal ependymomas** are the most common spinal cord tumour overall, seen both in adult and paediatric populations. 

This article specifically relates to spinal cord ependymomas. For a discussion of [posterior fossa ependymomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/posterior-fossa-ependymoma "Posterior fossa ependymoma") and for a general discussion of the pathology refer to the main article: [ependymoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ependymoma). Additionally, due to different imaging features and demographics, [supratentorial ependymomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/supratentorial-ependymoma "Supratentorial ependymomas") and [myxopapillary ependymomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/myxopapillary-ependymoma-1) are also discussed separately. 

#### Epidemiology

Spinal ependymomas are the most common [intramedullary neoplasm](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/intramedullary-spinal-tumours "Intramedullary spinal cord tumor") in adults, comprising 60% of all glial spinal cord tumours 7. They are the second most common intramedullary neoplasm in the paediatric population, representing 30% of paediatric intramedullary spinal neoplasms 6.

Peak incidence is in the fourth decade, with 39 years being the mean age at presentation. Males are more commonly affected than females.

There is an increased coincidence with [neurofibromatosis type 2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibromatosis-type-2-3).

#### Clinical presentation

Clinical presentation is similar to that of other [intramedullary spinal tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/intramedullary-spinal-tumours), with pain, weakness, and sensory changes common.

The frequent presentation of sensory symptoms may be explained by the proximity of these centrally located tumours to the [spinothalamic tracts](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/spinothalamic-tracts). Dominant motor symptoms are commonly associated with very large ependymomas 5.

#### Pathology

Ependymomas were thought to arise from ependymal cells lining the [central canal](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/central-canal) of the spinal cord, but more recently it has become evident that they actually arise from progenitor cells or radial glia-like stem cells 10. 

##### Microscopic appearance

On histologic evaluation, uniform moderately hyperchromatic nuclei are typically observed. Perivascular pseudorosettes are the classical finding.

##### Genetics

In a small subgroup of patients, _MYCN-_amplification is identified. This is a distinct tumour and is now recognised as a separate entity in the 5th edition (2021) of the [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1 "WHO classification of CNS tumours") 10. 

##### Grading

The vast majority of spinal ependymomas are WHO grade 2, with grade 3 tumours being rare.

Spinal ependymomas with _MYCN-_amplification are high-grade aggressive tumours, however, they are yet to be given a formal grade in the 5th edition (2021) of the [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) 10. 

#### Radiographic features

Ependymomas can occur anywhere along the spinal cord, however, the cervical cord is the most common site (44%). An additional 23% occur within the cervical cord and extend into the upper thoracic cord, and 26% occur in the thoracic cord alone 3.

##### Plain radiograph

Plain film features that may be seen with a spinal ependymoma include:

- [scoliosis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/scoliosis)
    
- [spinal canal widening](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=spinal-canal-widening)
    
- [vertebral body scalloping](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/vertebral-scalloping)
    
- [pedicle erosion](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=pedicle-erosion)
    
- [laminar thinning](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=laminar-thinning)
    

##### CT

CT may demonstrate:

- non-specific canal widening
    
- iso to slightly hyper-attenuating compared with normal spinal cord
    
- intense enhancement with iodinated contrast
    
- large lesions may cause scalloping of the posterior vertebral bodies and neural exit foraminal enlargement
    

##### MRI

MRI is the modality of choice for evaluating suspected spinal cord tumours. Features include:

- widened spinal cord (as ependymomas arise from ependymal cells lining the central canal, they tend to occupy the central portion of the spinal cord and cause symmetric cord expansion)
    
- although unencapsulated, they are well-circumscribed
    
- tumoural cysts are present in 22%; non-tumoural cysts are present in 62% 5
    
- [syringohydromyelia](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/syrinx-1) occurs in 9-50% of cases
    
- in contrast to intracranial ependymomas, calcification is uncommon
    
- average length of four vertebral body segments 10
    

###### Signal characteristics

- **T1:** most are isointense to hypointense; mixed-signal lesions are seen if cyst formation, tumour necrosis or haemorrhage has occurred
    
- **T2:** hyperintense
    
    - peritumoural oedema is seen in 60% of cases
        
    - associated haemorrhage leads to the “[cap sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cap-sign)” (a hypointense haemosiderin rim on T2 weighted images) in 20-33% of cases 5. The cap sign is suggestive of but not pathognomonic for ependymoma as it may also be seen in haemangioblastomas and paragangliomas
        
- **T1 C+ (Gd):** virtually all enhance strongly, somewhat inhomogeneously

#### Treatment and prognosis

Most ependymomas are slow-growing. They tend to compress adjacent spinal cord tissue rather than infiltrate it, almost always leaving a cleavage plane between the tumour and spinal cord tissue.

A complete curative excision may be achieved in approximately 50% of cases. In those patients, the 5-year survival rate is approximately 85%. In patients who are not able to achieve complete resection, the 5-year survival rate is approximately 57%. Recurrence is rare following complete excision 6.

Although metastatic spread is rare, the most common sites for metastases include the retroperitoneum, lymph nodes, and lungs 5.

Spinal ependymomas with _MYCN-_amplification are, in contrast, aggressive tumours with poor prognosis and frequent early dissemination throughout the central nervous system and reoccurrence despite resection10. 

#### Differential diagnosis

On MRI, the main differential diagnosis is an [astrocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/astrocytic-tumours). Certain imaging features may help to differentiate between the two, which are covered in this [article](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ependymoma-vs-astrocytoma-of-the-spinal-cord-2):

- [spinal astrocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/spinal-astrocytoma)
    
    - most common spinal cord tumour in children
        
    - eccentric location in the spinal canal
        
    - ill-defined
        
    - haemorrhage is uncommon
        
    - patchy irregular contrast enhancement
        
    - bone changes are infrequent
        
    - involvement of the entire cord diameter and longer cord segments favours an astrocytoma (i.e., if an intramedullary neoplasm involves the total spinal cord, it is more likely to be an astrocytoma 9 )
        
- [spinal cavernous malformation](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/spinal-cord-cavernous-malformation)
    
    - no enhancement
        
    - complete haemosiderin ring
