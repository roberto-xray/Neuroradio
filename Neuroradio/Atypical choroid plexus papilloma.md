**Atypical choroid plexus papillomas** are WHO grade 2 tumours derived from [choroid plexus](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/choroid-plexus "Choroid plexus")epithelium with intermediate clinical and pathological features between more indolent [choroid plexus papillomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/choroid-plexus-papilloma-1) and more aggressive [choroid plexus carcinomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/choroid-plexus-carcinoma).

As clinically, and on imaging, they are difficult to distinguish from [choroid plexus papillomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/choroid-plexus-papilloma-1) and therefore their description is not repeated here. 

#### Pathology

Atypical choroid plexus papillomas are considered WHO grade 2 tumours in the current (2021) [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1 "WHO classification of CNS tumours") 2. They are distinguished from [choroid plexus papillomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/choroid-plexus-papilloma-1)primarily on the basis of increased mitotic activity (≥2 mitoses per 10 high-power fields; choroid plexus carcinomas have ≥5 mitoses per 10 high-power fields) 1. 

Other features that may be present include 1:

- increased cellularity
- nuclear pleomorphism
- more solid growth pattern with blurring of papillary pattern
- necrosis
