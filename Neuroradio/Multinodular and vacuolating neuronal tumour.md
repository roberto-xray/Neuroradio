**Multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumours (MVNT)** are lesions with distinct cytoarchitectural patterns. 

Radiologically, MVNTs appear as small "bubbly" indolent subcortical tumours that sometimes present with [seizures](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/epilepsy). These tumours have been most frequently identified in the [temporal lobe](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/temporal-lobe), although that is likely to be due to that location being more likely to result in seizures than necessarily a predilection for that lobe 1-4.

#### Terminology

Lesions with identical imaging features have been described in the [cerebellum](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cerebellum) but have not been histologically confirmed and have, therefore, prudently been named **multinodular and vacuolating posterior fossa lesions of unknown significance (MV-PLUS)** 7.

#### Epidemiology

The true epidemiology of these tumours is unknown as they have only been relatively recently described and most are asymptomatic, so are likely undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as other lesions (see differential diagnosis below) further confounding epidemiology.

Reported cases are mostly in young to middle-aged individuals with adult-onset epilepsy, or identified incidentally 1-4,7. 

#### Clinical presentation

Other than some of these lesions being epileptogenic, it is likely that most are asymptomatic as presenting symptoms are usually difficult to reconcile with the lesion location 1-4,7.

#### Pathology

MVNTs are considered as one of the glioneuronal and neuronal tumours in the current (2021) [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) 9.

##### Microscopic appearance

The histopathological hallmark of MVNT is of neuroepithelial cells with conspicuous stromal vacuolation arranged in nodules principally within the deep cortical ribbon and superficial subcortical white matter 1-3. 

##### Immunophenotype

Immunostaining is positive for [synaptophysin](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/synaptophysin), HuC/HuD neuronal antigens and p62 but negative for other markers (e.g. [IDH1](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/isocitrate-dehydrogenase), [nestin](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/nestin), NeuN, neurofilament, [GFAP](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glial-fibrillary-acid-protein-gfap), and [CD34](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cd34)) 1-4. 

##### Genetics

Alterations in the MAPK pathway are important molecular characteristics 9. 

#### Radiographic features

##### CT

Smaller lesions are difficult to identify, but if seen will appear as non-enhancing low attenuation lesions deep to the cortex in the subcortical white matter. 

##### MRI

These tumours appear as a cluster of well-circumscribed high T2 signal "[bubbles](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/soap-bubble-appearance-differential-diagnosis-1 "Soap bubble appearance (differential diagnosis)")" located predominantly in the subcortical white matter but can involve the overlying cortex 1,3,4. 

- **T1:** hypointense to adjacent gray and white matter
    
- **T1 C+ (Gd)**
    
    - usually no enhancement
        
    - some faint focal enhancement may be seen 3,4
        
- **T2**
    
    - hyperintense to grey and white matter, almost as high as CSF
        
    - occasional central hypointense dot (also hypointense on FLAIR) 7,8
        
- **FLAIR:** does not suppress (remains high signal)
    

In the cerebellum (MV-PLUS) these lesions most commonly involve the vermis, often extending cerebellar hemispheres, but not the brainstem 7. 

#### Treatment and prognosis

MVNTs appear to be benign tumours with very indolent biological behaviour which can, if asymptomatic, be followed by imaging alone. In symptomatic patients (where the MVNT is causing seizures) surgical resection often controls seizures, with no tumour regrowth reported 1-4. 

#### History and etymology

MVNTs were first described in 2013 3 and included in the 2016 revised 4th edition of the [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) as an "architectural pattern" but recognised as a distinct entity in the 2021 5th edition 9.

#### Differential diagnosis

Possible considerations include:

- [dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour (DNET)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dysembryoplastic-neuroepithelial-tumour)
    
    - can appear similar with a [soap bubble appearance](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/soap-bubble-appearance-dnet "Soap bubble appearance (DNET)") but usually is mostly cortical (rather than subcortical)
        
    - often has [bright FLAIR rim](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bright-rim-sign-dnet-1)
        
- [focal cortical dysplasia](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/taylor-dysplasia) (type II) 
    
    - high T2 signal deep to the cortex is in the same location but is usually associated with a radial glial band ([transmantle sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/transmantle-sign-brain)) and with thickened abnormal overlying cortex
        
- [perivascular spaces](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/perivascular-spaces)
    
    - location can be similar
        
    - usually more elongated along vessel long axis
        
    - fully attenuating on FLAIR
        
- [gangliocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/gangliocytoma)
    
- [encephalomalacia](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/encephalomalacia) and [gliosis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/gliosis)
