**Glioblastomas (GBM)** are the most common adult primary [brain tumour](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/brain-tumours) and are unfortunately aggressive, relatively resistant to therapy, and have a corresponding poor prognosis.

They typically appear as heterogeneous masses centred in the white matter with irregular peripheral enhancement, central necrosis, and surrounding vasogenic oedema. 

Treatment primarily consists of surgery with concurrent radiotherapy and temozolomide. 

#### Terminology

Since 1926 when the term "glioblastoma multiforme" was coined, the definition of this tumour has substantially changed, particularly over the past decade with an increasing reliance on molecular markers to define these tumours. 

##### IDH-wildtype

In the 5th edition (2021) of the [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1), glioblastomas have been defined as diffuse astrocytic tumours in adults that must be IDH-wildtype, and are now an entirely separate diagnosis from [astrocytoma, IDH-mutant](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/astrocytoma-idh-mutant-1) grade 2, 3 or 4 5. 

##### Multiforme

Glioblastoma was previously known as glioblastoma multiforme; the multiforme referred to the tumour heterogeneity. In the revised 4th edition (2016) of the [WHO classification](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1), the term "multiforme" was dropped, with these tumours referred to merely as glioblastomas. In the revised 4th edition, the abbreviation GBM was kept for disambiguation 16 however it appears to have been deprecated in the 5th edition summary 20.

##### Primary and secondary

Glioblastomas had traditionally been divided into primary and secondary; the former arising de novo (90%) and the latter developing from a pre-existing lower grade tumour (10%). 

These historical terms now correlate closely to IDH-mutation status but should no longer be used. 

Primary glioblastomas largely equate to glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, whereas secondary glioblastomas now equate to [astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, WHO CNS grade 4](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/astrocytoma-idh-mutant-1).

##### Variants

In the 5th edition (2021) [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1), three glioblastoma histological variants are recognised (which are discussed separately), as well as a number of histological patterns which are discussed below 16.

The three recognised variants are:

1. [giant cell glioblastoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/giant-cell-glioblastoma)
    
2. [gliosarcoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/gliosarcoma)
    
3. [epithelioid glioblastoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/epithelioid-glioblastoma)
    

#### Epidemiology

Glioblastomas, now defined as IDH-wildtype tumours, are essentially tumours of adults, usually occurring after the age of 40 years with a peak incidence between 65 and 75 years of age. There is a slight male preponderance with a 3:2 M:F ratio 5. White patients are affected more frequently than other ethnicities: the prevalence in Europe and North America is 3-4 per 100,000, whereas in Asia it is 0.59 per 100,000 16.

The vast majority of glioblastomas are sporadic. Rarely they are related to prior radiation exposure ([radiation-induced glioma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/radiation-induced-glioma)). They can also occur as part of rare inherited tumour syndromes, such as [p53](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/p53) mutation-related syndromes including [neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurofibromatosis-type-1) and [Li-Fraumeni syndrome](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/li-fraumeni-syndrome). Other syndromes in which glioblastomas are encountered include [Turcot syndrome](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/turcot-syndrome), [Ollier disease](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/enchondromatosis), and [Maffucci syndrome](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/maffucci-syndrome).

#### Clinical presentation

Typically patients present in one of three ways:

- focal neurological deficit
    
- symptoms of increased intracranial pressure
    
- seizures
    

Rarely (<2%) intratumoural haemorrhage occurs and patients may present acutely with stroke-like symptoms and signs.

#### Diagnosis

The 5th edition (2021) of the [WHO classification of CNS tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) incorporates molecular parameters into the diagnostic criteria. In this classification, to make the diagnosis of a glioblastoma the following are required 20: 

- adult patient
    
- diffuse astrocytic tumour
    
- IDH-wildtype *
    
- and at least one of the following:
    
    - necrosis
        
    - microvascular proliferation
        
    - _TERT_ promoter mutation
        
    - _EGFR_ gene amplification
        
    - combined gain of whole chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10 [+7/-10] 
        

In the rare situation where these criteria are not met, it is likely the tumour will be denoted as [not elsewhere classified (NEC)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/not-elsewhere-classified-nec) although a variety of paediatric-type [diffuse gliomas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/diffuse-glioma) may be worth considering 20.  

An IDH wild-type status can be reached without the need for sequencing in patients over the age of 55 years on the basis of negative IDH-1 R132H immunohistochemistry, as the likelihood of finding other IDH mutations in older age is very unlikely 20. 

#### Pathology

Although glioblastomas can arise anywhere within the brain, they have a predilection for the subcortical white matter and deep grey matter of the cerebral hemispheres, particularly the temporal lobe 16. 

##### Macroscopic appearance

Glioblastomas are typically poorly marginated, diffusely infiltrating, necrotic masses localised to the cerebral hemispheres. The supratentorial white matter is the most common location.

These tumours may be firm or gelatinous. Considerable regional variation in appearance is characteristic. Some areas are firm and white, some are soft and yellow (secondary to necrosis), and others are cystic with local haemorrhage. Glioblastomas have significant variability in size from only a few centimetres to lesions that replace a hemisphere. Infiltration beyond the visible tumour margin is always present.

These tumours are [multifocal](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/multifocal-glioblastoma) in 20% of patients but are rarely truly [multicentric](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/multicentric-glioblastoma-1). They may also demonstrate a [gliomatosis cerebri](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/gliomatosis-cerebri "Gliomatosis cerebri") growth pattern.

##### Microscopic appearance

Histologically, pleomorphic astrocytes with marked atypia and numerous mitoses are seen. Necrosis and microvascular proliferation are hallmarks of glioblastomas.

Microvascular proliferation results in an abundance of new vessels with a poorly formed [blood-brain barrier (BBB)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/blood-brain-barrier-3) permitting the leakage of iodinated CT contrast and gadolinium into the adjacent extracellular interstitium resulting in the observed enhancement on CT and MRI respectively 11.

Oedema and enhancement are however also seen in lower grade tumours that lack endovascular proliferation (such as diffuse astrocytomas, IDH-mutant) and this is thought to be due to disruption of the normal blood-brain barrier by tumour produced factors. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for example has been shown to both disrupt tight junctions between endothelial cells and increase the formation of fenestrations 12.

###### Cellular variants

Glioblastomas are capable of demonstrating varied patterns, sometimes within one tumour. In addition to [giant cell glioblastoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/giant-cell-glioblastoma), [gliosarcoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/gliosarcoma), and [epithelioid glioblastoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/epithelioid-glioblastoma), other histological features are sometimes encountered which impact imaging appearance and biological behaviour. These include 16:

- gemistocytes
    
    - more commonly seen in grade 4 astrocytomas
        
- granular cells
    
    - histologically mimic macrophages and thus can lead to a misdiagnosis of macrophage-rich demyelination
        
- lipidized cells
    
- metaplasia
    
    - most commonly squamous epithelium
        
    - if dominant feature then a diagnosis of [gliosarcoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/gliosarcoma) should be considered
        
- multinucleated giant cells
    
    - a common feature of glioblastoma
        
    - if they are the dominant feature then a diagnosis of [giant cell glioblastoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/giant-cell-glioblastoma) should be considered
        
- primitive neuronal cells
    
    - previously known as glioblastoma with PNET-like component
        
    - more frequently has CSF spread
        
    - MYC or MYCN amplification common
        
    - IDH-mutant in 15-20% of cases
        
- small cell glioblastoma
    
    - histologically appears similar to oligodendroglioma, but usually demonstrate EGFR amplification
        
    - like oligodendrogliomas, they have a predilection for extensive cortical involvement
        

##### Immunophenotype

- [GFAP](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/gfap): positive but of variable intensity
    
- [S100](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/s100): positive
    
- [nestin](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/nestin): positive
    
- [p53 protein](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/p53): positive if TP53 mutated
    
- [EGFR](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/egfr): positive in 40-98% of cases 16
    
- [IDH-1 R132H](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/isocitrate-dehydrogenase): negative (by definition, otherwise not an IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, but rather an astrocytoma, IDH-mutant WHO CNS grade 4) 16
    
- H3 K27M mutation: negative (if positive then [diffuse midline glioma H3 K27-altered](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/diffuse-midline-glioma-h3-k27-altered))
    

##### Genetics

- [_EGFR_ gene amplification](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=egfr-gene-amplification)
    
- [_TERT_ promoter mutations](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/tert-promoter-mutations)
    
- combined gain of whole chromosome 7, loss of chromosome 10 [+7/-10] 
    
- alterations of the CDK4/6–RB1 cell-cycle pathway: 80% due to deletions of [CDKN2A](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/cdkn2ap16) 20
    

#### Radiographic features

Glioblastomas are typically large tumours at diagnosis. They often have thick, irregularly enhancing margins and a central necrotic core, which may also have a haemorrhagic component. They are surrounded by vasogenic-type oedema, which in fact usually contains infiltration by neoplastic cells.

Multifocal disease, which is found in ~20% of cases, is where multiple areas of enhancement are connected to each other by abnormal white matter signal, which represents microscopic spread to tumour cells. Multicentric disease, on the other hand, is where no such connection can be seen.

##### CT

- irregular thick margins: iso- to slightly hyperattenuating (high cellularity)
    
- irregular hypodense centre representing necrosis
    
- marked mass effect
    
- surrounding vasogenic oedema
    
- haemorrhage is occasionally seen
    
- calcification is uncommon
    
- intense irregular, heterogeneous enhancement of the margins is almost always present
    

##### MRI

- **T1**
    
    - hypo to isointense mass within the white matter
        
    - central heterogeneous signal (necrosis, intratumoural haemorrhage)
        
- **T1 C+ (Gd)**
    
    - enhancement is variable but is almost always present
        
    - typically peripheral and irregular with nodular components
        
    - usually surrounds necrosis
        
- **T2/FLAIR**
    
    - hyperintense
        
    - surrounded by vasogenic oedema
        
    - flow voids are occasionally seen
        
- **GE/SWI**
    
    - susceptibility artifact on T2* from blood products (or occasionally calcification)
        
    - low-intensity rim from blood products 6
        
        - incomplete and irregular in 85% when present
            
        - mostly located inside the peripheral enhancing component
            
        - absent [dual rim sign](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dual-rim-sign-brain-abscess)
            
- **DWI/ADC**
    
    - solid component
        
        - elevated signal on DWI is common in solid/enhancing component
            
        - diffusion restriction is typically intermediate similar to normal white matter, but significantly elevated compared to surrounding vasogenic oedema (which has facilitated diffusion)
            
        - ADC values in the solid component tend to be similar to normal white matter 745 ± 135 x 10-6 mm2/s 13
            
    - non-enhancing necrotic/cystic component
        
        - the vast majority (>90%) have facilitated diffusion (ADC values >1000 x 10-6 mm2/s)
            
        - care must be taken in interpreting cavities with blood product
            
- **MR perfusion:** rCBV elevated compared to lower grade tumours and normal brain
    
- **MR spectroscopy**
    
    - typical spectroscopic characteristics include
        
        - choline: increased
            
        - lactate: increased
            
        - lipids: increased
            
        - NAA: decreased
            
        - _myo_-inositol: decreased
            

##### PET

PET demonstrates the accumulation of FDG (representing increased glucose metabolism) which typically is greater than or similar to metabolism in grey matter.

##### Radiogenomics

A number of features are seen to correlate with molecular marker status, such as MGMT promoter methylation, which typically demonstrates:

- high ADC values
    
- limited surrounding oedema
    
- low CBV
    

This has a sensitivity of 79% (95% CI, 72-85%) and specificity of 78% (95% CI, 71-84%) 19.

#### Radiology report

When reporting a new diagnosis of a mass that is likely a glioblastoma, it is useful to include:

- morphology
    
    - size in three dimensions
        
    - presence and degree of central necrosis
        
    - non-enhancing tumour involving cortex, deep grey or white matter: look at ADC for lower values
        
- relationship to/involvement of
    
    - [eloquent areas](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/eloquent-cortex "Eloquent cortex")
        
    - major white matter tracts
        
    - large vessels
        
- extension
    
    - across midline
        
    - into brainstem
        
    - subependymal spread
        
    - CSF dissemination
        

#### Treatment and prognosis

Biopsy and tumour debulking with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy (temozolomide) are the most common treatment ([Stupp protocol](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/stupp-protocol-for-glioblastoma)). Newer therapies include antiangiogenesis (e.g. bevacizumab) and immunotherapy.

Although in individuals 70 years of age or younger a standard Stupp protocol is usual, in older individuals the optimum treatment regimen is less well established 15,21. This is particularly the case in the very elderly or those with significant comorbidities 21.

In such cases, surgical resection has less marked survival benefit. Radiotherapy is usually administered as a shorter course (e.g. 25-40 Gy in 5-15 daily fractions, rather than 60 Gy over 6 weeks), but even in this setting adding temozolomide significantly increases survival, especially in [MGMT methylated](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/methylguanine-dna-methyltransferase-mgmt) (inactive) tumours 15,21. 

Despite all of this, even in the best-case scenario, glioblastoma carries a poor prognosis with a median survival of <2 years 15.

Negative prognostic factors include:

- increased necrosis 10
    
- greater enhancement 10
    
- deep location (e.g. thalamus)
    
- [MGMT](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/methylguanine-dna-methyltransferase-mgmt) not-methylated
    
- increased age
    
- lower pre-diagnosis functional status (e.g. [ECOG performance status](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ecog-performance-status))
    

##### Follow-up

Glioblastomas should be followed up closely with MRI.

###### Immediate post-operative imaging

Generally a scan is obtained within 24-48 hours of surgery to assess residual disease. Early scanning is necessary to avoid post-operative enhancement that can make interpretation difficult. It should be noted, however, that some post-operative enhancement can occur within the first day post surgery 22 and therefore it is essential that these scans are interpreted alongside the pre-operative scan.

###### Ongoing imaging

Although timing and frequency will vary between institutions and treating surgeons/oncologists typically scans are obtained every 8 to 12 weeks. In individuals who have no residual macroscopic disease and remain stable for a protracted time, the frequency of follow-up imaging can be gradually decreased. In contrast, sometimes it is worthwhile performing an earlier scan to problem-solve ambiguous imaging features.

The primary aims of on-going follow-up are: 

- identify tumour progression and complications
    
- distinguish tumour progression from [pseudoprogression](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/tumour-pseudoprogression-brain-tumors)
    
- distinguish [pseudoresponse](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/tumour-pseudoresponse) from tumour progression
    

###### Response assessment criteria

Glioblastomas have been the subject of close trial scrutiny with many new chemotherapeutic agents showing promise. As such a number of criteria have been created over the years to assess response to treatment. Currently, the response assessment in neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria are most widely used. Other historical systems are worth knowing to allow the interpretation of older data. These systems for response criteria for first-line treatment of glioblastomas include 9:

- [RANO criteria](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/rano-criteria-for-glioma) (most commonly used today)
    
- [Macdonald criteria](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/macdonald-criteriafor-glioblastoma)
    
- [AVAglio criteria](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/avaglio-criteria-for-glioblastoma)
    
- [RTOG 0825 criteria](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=rtog-0825-criteria-for-glioblastoma)
    
- [BT-RADS](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=bt-rads)
    

#### History and etymology

The original term glioblastoma multiforme was coined in 1926 by Percival Bailey and Harvey Cushing; the suffix multiforme was given to describe the various appearances of haemorrhage, necrosis, and cysts.

#### Differential diagnosis

General imaging differential considerations include:

- [astrocytoma, IDH-mutant](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/astrocytoma-idh-mutant-1) WHO CNS grade 4
    
    - may appear very similar/indistinguishable
        
    - generally younger patients
        
- [cerebral metastasis](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/brain-metastases)
    
    - may look identical
        
    - both may appear multifocal
        
    - metastases usually are centred on grey-white matter junction and spare the overlying cortex
        
    - rCBV in the "oedema" will be reduced 
        
- [primary CNS lymphoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/lymphomas-of-the-central-nervous-system)
    
    - should be considered especially in patients with [AIDS](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/aids-defining-illness-2 "AIDS defining illness"), as in this setting central necrosis is more common
        
    - otherwise usually homogeneously enhancing
