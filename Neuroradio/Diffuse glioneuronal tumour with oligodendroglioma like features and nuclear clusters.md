**Diffuse glioneuronal tumour with oligodendroglial features and nuclear clusters** is a novel glioneuronal tumour entity recently identified by a characteristic methylation profile 1.

#### Terminology

The exact nature of diffuse glioneuronal tumours with oligodendroglial features and nuclear clusters has yet to be well defined. In fact, its histological features almost overlap with other better-known tumours such as [oligodendroglioma grade 3](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/oligodendroglioma) and [primitive neuroectodermal tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/primitive-neuroectodermal-tumour-of-the-cns) 1.

It has been provisionally included in the 5th Edition (2021) [WHO brain tumour classification](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/who-classification-of-cns-tumours-1) 2, but more studies are needed for full acceptance. It has been proposed it should be considered a WHO grade 2 tumour 1. 

#### Epidemiology

Diffuse glioneuronal tumour with oligodendroglial features and nuclear clusters occurs mainly in children, although some higher-age cases have been described 1, 3.

#### Pathology

Diffuse glioneuronal tumour with oligodendroglial features and nuclear clusters demonstrates histological, molecular and immunophenotype features reminiscent of a wide spectrum of tumours, such as [oligodendroglioma grade 3](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/oligodendroglioma), [neurocytoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/neurocytoma),  [dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour (DNET)](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/dysembryoplastic-neuroepithelial-tumour), [primitive neuroectodermal tumours](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/primitive-neuroectodermal-tumour-of-the-cns) and even [glioblastoma](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glioblastoma-idh-wildtype) 1, 3. Therefore it is likely that in the near future many previously diagnosed high-grade CNS tumours will be re-assigned to this new entity based on its specific methylation profile.

###### Location

It arises in the cerebral hemispheres, preferentially from the temporal lobes 1.

###### Microscopic appearance

Diffuse glioneuronal tumour with oligodendroglial features and nuclear clusters demonstrates clear cell features with moderate to high cellularity and diffuse infiltration, round nuclei with oligodendroglioma-like perinuclear halos, nuclear clusters and vascular proliferation 1.

###### Immunophenotype

- [MAP2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/missing?article%5Btitle%5D=map2): positive
- [GFAP](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/glial-fibrillary-acid-protein-gfap): negative

#### Radiographic features

##### MRI

- **T1**: hypointense
- **T2/FLAIR:** hyperintense with no perilesional oedema
- **T1 C+ (Gd):** poor enhancement 3

#### Treatment and prognosis

Data about the treatment and prognosis of these newly characterised tumours are still limited. In the few reported cases 1,3, surgical resection was the treatment of choice with adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Prognosis is generally positive although recurrence is possible.

#### Differential diagnosis

Possible imaging differential considerations include:
